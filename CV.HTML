                    Women"</a></b>
                <span class="date">Spring 2016</span><br /><p>Since its first publication in 1905,
                    Upton Sinclair's <i>The Jungle</i> has long been recognized as one of the most
                    famous pieces of muckraking literature for its response to unsanitary conditions
                    in the Chicago meat-packing industry and its influence on President Theodore
                    Roosevelt's implementation of Food and Drug regulations. Contrary to critiques
                    of <i>The Jungle</i> as failed literature, Bakhtin's theory of heteroglossia
                    helps to demonstrate how the <i>The Jungle</i> meets the distinguishing
                    qualities of a novel. Yet this was the only work of Sinclair's numerous
                    publications with an enduring reputation, and its literary fame branded Sinclair
                    as a socialist extremist. A deconstruction of the novel’s language demonstrates
                    how it fell short in representing women's labor reform and labor conditions in
                    Chicago. (<a
