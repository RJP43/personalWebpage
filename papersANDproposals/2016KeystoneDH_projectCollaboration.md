Managing a project team of undergraduates requires organization, accountability, and lots of GitHub activity. This presentation will take a behind the scenes look at the GitHub collaboration of Pitt-Greensburg's student projects and the DHClass-Hub. Rebecca Parker, the 2015-2016 teaching assistant to Dr. Beshero-Bondar of the University of Pittsburgh, will detail the importance of Git's version control system and the social media aspects of GitHub that make it the ideal set of tools for project collaboration. An overview of how to use Git shell (the command line Git interface) will encourage the audience to "look under the hood" of the Pitt-Greensburg Digital Humanities Course. A run through of Rebecca's [CitySlaveGirls GitHub Repository](https://github.com/RJP43/CitySlaveGirls) will model how a project with a fluctuating team of editors can maintain project stability with GitHub's detailed repository history recording and collaborator tracking. The goal of this presentation will be to orient the audience with Git and GitHub in hopes of changing the stigma of confusion and difficulty surrounding them. Through a better understanding of Git and GitHub, Digital Humanists will be motivated to enter into the world of computer programmers and large-scale collaboration projects, to the likes of Twitter and Google, that have been using Git for years.
