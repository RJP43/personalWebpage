Managing a project team especially of undergraduates requires organization, accountability, and lots of GitHub activity. This presentation will take a behind the scenes look at the GitHub collaboration of Pitt-Greensburg's student projects and the [DHClass-Hub](https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub). Rebecca Parker, the 2015-2016 teaching assistant to Dr. Beshero-Bondar of the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg, will detail the important uses of Git's version control system and the social media aspects of GitHub that make it an ideal set of tools for project collaboration. She will demonstrate her personal use of GitHub as well as the unique uses of GitHub that are experienced by Pitt-Greensburg students. An overview of how to use Git shell (the command line Git interface) will encourage the audience to "look under the hood" of the Pitt-Greensburg Digital Humanities Courses. Audience members can expect to leave this presentation with the ability to collaborate on projects of any size using Git. A run through of Rebecca's [CitySlaveGirls GitHub Repository](https://github.com/RJP43/CitySlaveGirls) will model how a project with a fluctuating team of editors can maintain project stability with GitHub's detailed repository history recording and collaborator tracking. The main goal of this presentation will be to orient the audience with Git and GitHub in hopes of changing the stigma of confusion and difficulty surrounding their use.
