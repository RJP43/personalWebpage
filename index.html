                <p>Rebecca Parker is a senior at the <a href="http://www.upg.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg</a>, where she is pursuing a double-major bachelor's degree in English Literature and Social Sciences. She is also on track to earn the <a href="http://greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/info/digital-studies">Digital Studies Certificate</a>. On campus, Rebecca is an active member of <a href="http://www.english.org/sigmatd/">Sigma Tau Delta</a> (the English honor society), <a href="http://www.pigammamu.org/">Pi Gamma Mu</a> (the Social Sciences honor society) and <a href="http://www.phikappaphi.org/">Phi Kappa Phi</a> (an interdisciplinary honor society).

                <p><a id="nell" href="http://nelson.newtfire.org/">The Restoration of Nell Nelson</a> seeks to revive the instrumental work of Helen Cusack-Carvalho, a.k.a. Nell Nelson, that exposed the cruel and unsanitary working conditions of Chicago's manufacturing industry of the late nineteenth century. Nelson's series, "City Slave Girls," was published in The Chicago Daily Times in late-July, 1888. The "City Slave Girls" series put into question the practices of the most prestigious men of Chicago; yet, Nell Nelson was a woman unable to even vote due to the gender restraints of her time. Although the significance of the series was recognized at the time of publication and for some time after, Nelson's role in exposing the hardships of the industrialization lacks any proper representation in all realms of history. Nelson's work is a monumental resource of information for women's history, labor history, and the history of undercover journalism. The Restoration of Nell Nelson Project began as an in-depth capstone paper and presentation for completion of Rebecca's history-based Social Science Area Bachelor's degree. During the beginning stages of research it became apparent that Nelson and her series lacked any holistic representation in history or truly digital representation. Then, using the research and sources from which the history capstone was built, the project took a turn into digital humanities scholarship in the spring of 2014. This project is still in progress.

This website was created as the final research project for the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg's History of the English Language Course taught by <a href="http://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/people/sayre-n-greenfield-phd">Dr. Greenfield</a>. This project is still in progress. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/RJP43/OneWordHistory_CHEAP">related GitHub page</a> for development details. When completed, this project will describe the history of cheap's usage in the English language and how it has developed from the earliest records of the word to the present era.</p>
