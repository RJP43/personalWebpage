                <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
                <p>To the reader unfamiliar with the unhappy byways of sexual pathology, the story
                    told in this book must seem incredibly fantastic. Incredible as it may seem, it
                    is true. Or, rather, the facts are true, though I think there is room for
                    differences of opinion about the interpretation of the facts.</p>
                <p>There would seem to be no doubt about the following points. A well-known Danish
                    painter, whose identity is shrouded in this book under the name of <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>, was born in the 'eighties of the
                    last century. At about the age of twenty he married, and was sufficiently normal
                    both psychologically and physically to be able to fulfil his functions as a
                    husband. Some years later a purely fortuitous happening led him to dress up as a
                    woman, and the disguise was so successful that he followed it by dressing up as
                    a woman on several occasions, on each of which those who were in the secret were
                    surprised at his apparent femininity. In fun, one of his friends dubbed him,
                    when disguised as a woman, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. Gradually
                    he began to feel a change taking place in himself. He began to feel that
                        "<persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>" was a real individual, who shared
                    the same body as his male selfâ€” <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. The
                    second personality, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, became more and
                    more important, and <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> became convinced
                    that he was a sort of twin being, part male and part</p>

                <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
                <p>female in the one body. He began to suffer from disturbances every month in the
                    shape of bleedings from the nose and elsewhere, which he came to regard as
                    representative of menstruation, and he sought the help of many doctors, who,
                    however, were unable to relieve him.</p>
                <p>He began to study books on sexual pathology and gradually came to the conclusion
                    that although his external organs were those of a male, and quite normal (though
                    perhaps rather undeveloped), yet his body contained in it the internal sexual
                    organs of a female in addition.</p>
                <p>Some of the doctors to whom he went thought him neurotic, some thought him
                    homosexual; but he himself denied the truth of both these diagnoses. One doctor
                    treated him with X-rays, and later on <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> attributed the shrunken state of the female sexual
                    organs which were found in his abdomen to the destructive effect of this X-ray
                    treatment.</p>
                <p>Gradually the female personality, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, took
                    on such importance that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> felt that,
                    unless in some way his male self could be made to give place to <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, he could not go on living. By this time he
                    was in his forties, and his failure to find any doctor who could help him to
                    realize his desire to become a woman led him to the project of suicide if
                    nothing should happen within the next year.</p>
                <p>Just as things seemed at their worst he met a <!-- <persName> -->famous German
                    doctor from <placeName>Dresden</placeName><!-- </persName> -->, who agreed that
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was probably an intermediate
                    sexual type, furnished, by some sport of nature, with both male and female
                    gonads. He explained that</p>
                <pb n="12"/>
                <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
                <p><num style="page">vii</num></p>
                <p>there were probably rudimentary ovaries in <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' abdomen, but that these were unable to develop properly
                    because of the inhibiting influence of the testicles which <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> also possessed.</p>
                <p>He proposed that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> should go to
                        <placeName>Berlin</placeName>, where certain investigations were to be
                    undertaken. If these investigations confirmed his suppositions he promised to
                    remove <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' male organs and transplant
                    into him ovaries from a young woman, which would, as the work of the
                        <placeName>Steinach school</placeName> had shown, activate the rudimentary
                    ovaries lying dormant in <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>'
                    abdomen.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> went to
                        <placeName>Berlin</placeName>. The investigations confirmed
                    <!-- <persName> -->the German doctor<!-- </persName> -->'s theory, and <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> embarked on a series of operations. The
                    first one was castration. His testicles were removed. A few months later he went
                    to Dresden, where his penis was also removed, his abdomen was opened, and the
                    presence of rudimentary ovaries was established, and at the same time ovarian
                    tissue from a healthy young woman of twenty-six was transplanted into him. A
                    little later he underwent another operation, the nature of which is not
                    explained, though it had something to do with the insertion of a canula.</p>
                <p>By this time he felt himself to be entirely a woman. The Danish authorities
                    issued him a new passport as a female in the name of <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili Elbe</persName>, and the <persName>King of
                            <placeName>Denmark</placeName></persName> declared his marriage null and
                    void. With his consent, and indeed at his suggestion, his
                    <!-- <persName> -->former wife<!-- </persName> --> married a

                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and <!-- <persName> -->his
                    wife<!-- </persName> --> for many years, now fell in love with <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, and proposed marriage to her.</p>
                <p>Before consenting to the marriage <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> made
                    another journey to the <!-- <persName> -->German surgeon at
                        <placeName>Dresden</placeName><!-- </persName> --> to tell him that she had
                    received the offer of marriage and to ask him if he could carry out yet another
                    operation on her to enable her to function completely as a woman, to take the
                    female part in intercourse, and to become a mother. An operation for this
                    purpose was carried out; but shortly afterwards <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> died in <placeName>Dresden</placeName> of heart
                    trouble.</p>
                <p>There seems to be no question that the above statements are true. The case was
                    kept secret at first, but through a
                    <!-- <persName> -->friend<!-- </persName> -->'s indiscretion the secret leaked
                    out, and the case was reported in the German and Danish newspapers and caused a
                    great sensation in the year 1931, some time before <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>'s death.</p>
                <p>. . . . .</p>
                <p>The story of this strange case has been written by <persName>Niels
                        Hoyer</persName>, partly from his own knowledge, partly from material
                    dictated by <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> herself, partly from
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>'s diaries, and partly from letters
                    written by <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> and other persons concerned.
                    The <!-- <persName> -->biographer<!-- </persName> --> states that
                    <!-- <persName> -->the surgeon who performed the operation<!-- </persName> -->
                    has passed his account of the case as correct.</p>
                <p>. . . . .</p>
                <p>The case falls within the domain of sexual pathology, and comes within the
                    category of sexual intermediacy. We are accustomed to classify individuals as
                    male or female, the classification</p>

                <p><num style="page">ix</num></p>
                <p>being made at birth by inspection of the external genital organs. But modern
                    sexology has pointed out the inadequacy of this rough and ready classification.
                    It must be remembered that in the early embryo it is impossible, even by the
                    most careful examination, to determine the sex. Gradually a little eminence
                    grows up which forms the rudiments of the sexual organs. At first the rudiments
                    of the organs of both sexes develop, but later only one set continues
                    developing, while the other set remains very rudimentary. If development
                    proceeds normally, the individual differentiates sufficiently to be classified
                    for all practical purposes as a male or as a female. But even in the most normal
                    and unambiguous individual, the rudiments of the organs of the other sex are
                    present throughout life. Thus the male possesses a rudimentary uterus and the
                    female a rudimentary penis. So far, we have been speaking of the primary sexual
                    organs, or genital organs.</p>
                <p>But there are a number of other, or secondary sexual characters (breasts, width
                    of pelvis, hair, etc.) which differ in the two sexes, and individuals who are
                    classified as male may have secondary sexual characters of a female type and
                    vice versa. When carefully investigated even the apparently most normal male may
                    be found to have certain physical sex characters approximating to the female
                    type, and the apparently most normal female to have sex characters approximating
                    to the male type. One is led to the conclusion that the hundred-per-cent male
                    and the hundred-per-cent female are theoretical types which do not exist in
                    reality.</p>

                <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
                <p>sexual characters, but there are psychological sexual characters which differ as
                    between the sexes, too. Sometimes the presence of marked physical
                    characteristics of the opposite sex is not accompanied by any noticeable
                    psychological intermediacy, or by any change in the direction of sexual desire,
                    i.e., by any trace of homosexual feeling. In other cases some degree of
                    homosexual feeling is present and in yet other cases the sexual intermediacy is
                    marked much more psychologically than it is physically. For a full discussion of
                    this subject the reader is referred to Professor <persName>Gregorio
                        MaraÃ±on</persName>'s book, <hi rend="italic">The Evolution of Sex and
                        Intersexual Conditions</hi>, which is available in an English
                    translation.</p>
                <p>Cases occur, though rarely, where an individual possesses the genital organs of
                    one sex, and in addition more or less complete genital organs belonging to the
                    other sex as well. Such anomalies are known as hermaphrodites, though in human
                    beings the hermaphrodism always seems to be incomplete. There is a small number
                    of curious cases of this sort recorded in sexological literature, though no
                    other case, so far as I know, has been so extreme, or so well recorded, as the
                    case of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>.</p>
                <p>Thus, when I was a medical student in <placeName>Sydney, Australia</placeName>,
                    about the year 1912, a man was admitted to the wards of my hospital suffering
                    from regularly recurring hemorrhages, which were thought to be due to kidney
                    disease. Investigation showed that although his external genital organs were
                    normal, and he was married and able to perform the sexual act as a male, his
                    body contained ovaries.</p>
                <pb n="16"/>
                <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
                <p><num style="page">xi</num></p>
                <p>In <placeName>Berlin</placeName> in 1923, I saw, at the clinic of a colleague, an
                    individual who was apparently male, but who felt himself to be a female just as
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> did. This patient, too, had his
                    male organs removed at his own request, and was given injections of ovarian
                    extract. No operation was ever undertaken to determine whether ovaries were
                    present in his body or not. I saw himâ€”or herâ€”again in 1926, after the removal of
                    the male organs, and quite recently I received a report about the case. The
                    individual is very unhappy, and has not succeeded in becoming completely a
                    woman.</p>
                <p><persName>Professor Steinach</persName>, of <placeName>Vienna</placeName>, has
                    for some decades been carrying on a series of investigations into sexual
                    physiology, and has had considerable success in changing males into females and
                    females into males among lower animals, such as rats and guinea-pigs. He has
                    even been successful in enabling a formerly male rat to develop breast glands
                    which function to the extent of producing milk to nourish the litter of another
                    rat; but up to the present he has not succeeded in completing the transformation
                    so that a former male could become pregnant and give birth to a litter.</p>
                <p>Among birds, there are a number of cases on record where hens, which have laid
                    eggs and produced many chickens, have gradually changed their plumage, begun to
                    crow, and developed into cocks, and as cocks have fertilized other hens.</p>
                <p>But in human beings, although mild grades of sexual intermediacy are by no means
                    rare, cases like that of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>
                    arise but seldom; and I cannot help thinking that until we know more about
                    sexual physiology it is unwise to</p>

                <p>carry out, even at the patient's own request, such operations as were performed
                    in this case. It would, I think, have been better to try the effect of
                    psychological treatment. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>
                    might either have been cured, or at least enabled to adapt himself to life. By
                    proper psychological treatment the duplication of personality might have been
                    resolved and he might have been enabled to lead a reasonably happy life instead
                    of embarking on a series of painful and dangerous operations which ended only
                    with his death.</p>
                <p>There seems to be no need to disclose the real names of the persons mentioned in
                    this book, except to say that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>

                <p>In accordance with <persName key="courtaud">Lili Elbe</persName>'s last wishes, I
                    have arranged the papers she left behind in the form of this book. It is a
                    veracious life story, recorded by a person whose earthly course assumed the
                    shape of an unparalleled and incredible tragedy of fate, the life story of a
                    person whose afflictions were outside the range of our ordinary ideas.</p>
                <p>The German doctor whose bold operations enabled the mortally ill and despairing
                    Danish painter <persName>Einar Wegener</persName> (<persName key="sparreAn"

                    dictates of his nature has approved the book in its German version. At <persName

                    employed for the persons who figure in her narrative.</p>
                <p>She has retained her own name, chosen out of gratitude to the

                    destiny<!-- </persName> -->.</p>
                <p>The German edition of this book was preceded by a Danish edition, and
                    arrangements are being made for editions of the book to appear in other
                    languages.</p>
                <p><persName key="courtaud">Lili Elbe</persName>'s book must be dedicated in
                    gratitude to her great helper in <placeName>Dresden</placeName>, her life

                <p>The scene is <placeName>Paris</placeName> in the <placeName>Quartier Saint
                        Germain</placeName>: The time a February evening in 1930. In a quiet street
                    which harbours a stately palace there is a small restaurant, whose regular
                    customers are foreigners, and mostly artists.</p>
                <p>Among them this evening were <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and
                        <persName key="sparreGre"><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                        Sparre</persName>, two Danish painters, and their Italian friend <persName
                        key="rossiniEr">Ernesto Rossini</persName>, with his elegant French wife
                        <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>. The friends had not seen each
                    other for a whole year. One couple had been travelling in the North, the other
                    in the South of <placeName>Europe</placeName>.</p>
                <p>"Skaal!" cried <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, in the good old
                    Nordic way, and raised his glass. "This wine, children, is for the soul what
                    alpine sun is for the body. And this reminds me of a glorious legend of the
                    cathedral of <placeName>Seville</placeName>, which <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> and I were admiring a short time ago. Under the plinth of
                    the highest column they have immured a sunbeamâ€”that is the whole legend."</p>
                <p>"Splendid!" cried <persName key="rossiniEr">Ernesto</persName>, with enthusiasm.
                    "Heavenly, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>!" chimed in <persName
                        key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, warmly pressing his hand.</p>
                <p>And <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> smiled happily and

                        >Ernesto</persName> exchanged a multitude of travel impressionsâ€”wanderings
                    through museums and disreputable alleys in <placeName>Cadiz</placeName> and
                        <placeName>Antwerp</placeName>, voyages of discovery through bazaars in the
                        <placeName>Balkans</placeName> and in marine stores in <placeName>The
                        Hague</placeName> and <placeName>Amsterdam</placeName>. Each tried to outdo
                    the other. Thus <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>; thus <persName
                        key="rossiniEr">Ernesto</persName>â€”completely absorbed in their subject,
                    their keen eyes alight with the enthusiasm of the artist.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was leaning attentive,
                    while <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> was whispering in his ear the
                    latest amusing, and even scandalous, anecdotes from <placeName>Rome</placeName>
                    and <placeName>Madrid</placeName>.</p>
                <p>"You are not drinking too much, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>?"
                    suddenly inquired <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, pausing in the
                    midst of one of the "latest" incredible stories, only to be related in a
                    whisper. . . . She had noticed the growing nervous excitement of her companion.
                    "You want to be fit and well to-night."</p>
                <p><persName key="rossiniEr">Ernesto</persName> and <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> caught up <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>'s
                    words. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> gazed mutely at <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. <persName key="rossiniEr"
                        >Ernesto</persName> took his friend's hand. "Is <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> causing you trouble again?" he inquired, full of
                    solicitude.</p>
                <p>"You've said it, <persName key="rossiniEr">Ernesto</persName>," replied <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> very seriously. "This condition is
                    gradually becoming intolerable. Lili is no longer content to share her existence
                    with me. She wants to have an existence of her own. I don't know whether you
                    understand me. . . . Iâ€”I'm no longer any use. Cannot do anything more. I'm
                    finished. <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> has known this for a long
                    time. That's how matters stand. And consequently she rebels more vigorously
                    every day. What shall I do with myself? The question may sound strange, though

                    for the bar.</p>
                <p>"Tell me quickly," whispered <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, looking

                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had lost her smile. "He has never been

                    regarded her friend inquiringly. "Well, listen. A very good friend of ours is

                    to-day, shortly after we had spoken to <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> on the telephone. And then I thought at once: 'If

                    from <placeName>Dresden</placeName>.' And the matter is urgent, as the doctor

                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> made a listless movement with her

                    call upon you early in the morning."</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> returned at this moment, holding up
                    two bottles of Asti as if they were booty.</p>
                <p>. . . . .</p>
                <p>When <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> were strolling at a later hour along the avenue near
                    which their studio dwelling was situated, she avowed at first cautiously, but
                    afterwards with energy, what she had arranged with <persName key="rossiniEl"
                        >Elena</persName>. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was beside
                    himself. He stood still in the middle of the road. He would not be examined
                    either by a German or by a French, or by an Indian mountebank. He was through
                    with these bloodsuckers.</p>
                <p>He had been ill for many years. Innumerable doctors and specialists had examined
                    himâ€”without result. Now he was utterly tired. Life had become a torment to
                    him.</p>
                <p>Nobody understood what was wrong with him. But his sufferings were of the
                    strangest kind. A specialist in <placeName>Versailles</placeName> had without
                    further ado declared him to be an hysterical subject; apart from this he was a
                    perfectly normal man, who had only to behave reasonably like a man to become
                    perfectly well again; all that the patient lacked was the conviction that he <hi
                        rend="italic">was</hi> perfectly healthy and normal.</p>
                <p>A young doctor, likewise in <placeName>Versailles</placeName>, had</p>
                <pb n="24"/>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">19</num></p>
                <p>indeed pronounced that "everything was not as it should be" . . . but he had
                    dismissed <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> with the following
                    reassuring words: "Don't distress yourself about your physical state. You are so
                    healthy and unimpaired that you could stand anything."</p>
                <p>A radiologist had been very active, but he had nearly killed <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>.</p>
                <p>The diagnosis of a medical personage from <placeName>Vienna</placeName>, a man of
                    somewhat mystical temperament and a friend of <persName>Steinach</persName>,
                    pointed in the right direction. "Only a bold and daring doctor can help you,"
                    this man had declared; "but where will you find such a doctor to-day?"</p>
                <p>Thereupon <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had taken heart and
                    approached three surgeons.</p>
                <p>The first had declared that he had never in all his life performed "beautifying
                    operations"; the second examined exclusively the blind-gut; and the third
                    declared <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> to be "perfectly
                    crazy".</p>
                <p>Most people would probably have agreed with this third specialist: for <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> believed that in reality he was not a <hi
                        rend="italic">man</hi>, but a <hi rend="italic">woman</hi>.</p>
                <p>And he had grown tired of it all, and sworn to himself that he would not visit
                    any more doctors. He had made up his mind to end his existence. The first of May
                    was to be the fatal day. Spring is a dangerous time for people who are sick and
                    tired.</p>
                <p>He had thought over everything, even the mode of his departure. It was to be, to
                    some extent, a polite obeisance to Nature. Now it was February. March and April
                    would be waiting months. A reprieve . . . he felt calm.</p>

                <p>The only thing which tormented him, which pained him unspeakably, was the thought
                    of his wifeâ€”the loyal friend and companion of his life.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete Sparre</persName> was an artist of great talent.
                    Her pictures made an exciting and tingling impression, like a vapour from the
                    jungles of <placeName>Paris</placeName>.</p>
                <p>Perhaps because their marriage had been, above all, a comradeship almost from the
                    beginning, they both found life pleasant and worth while only when they were
                    together.</p>
                <p>They were hardly adult and were still attending the
                        <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName> academy of art when they had married. A
                    few days before the wedding <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had sold
                    his very first picture at his very first exhibition. They had lived mostly
                    abroad, chiefly in <placeName>Paris</placeName>, and this life abroad had
                    contributed to strengthen the tie which bound them.</p>
                <p>It was therefore inevitable that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>
                    frequently had moments when it seemed as if he were behaving like a traitor
                    towards <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. He had been forced to
                    recognize that he could work no longer, and he was apprehensive of becoming a
                    burden on <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. This thought had been
                    worrying him for months, poisoning the fount of his enjoyment.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was aware of his thoughts. Yet she
                    suspected that whatever she proposed to offer in the way of new hope would prove
                    futile. There were so many things that bound them together, so many struggles,
                    so many memories, bright and dark, and, perhaps most of all, <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. For <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> was, in fact, two beings: a man, <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, and a girl, <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>. They might even be called twins who had both taken
                    possession of one body at the same time.</p>

                <p><num style="page">21</num></p>
                <p>In character they were entirely different.</p>
                <p>Gradually <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> had gained such predominance
                    over <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> that she could still be traced
                    in him, even after she had retired, but never the reverse. Whereas he felt tired
                    and seemed to welcome death, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> was joyous
                    and in the freshness of youth.</p>
                <p>She had become <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s favourite model.
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> wandered through her best
                    works.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> felt herself to be the protectress of
                    this carefree and helpless <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. And
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> felt himself to be the protector
                    of both. His ultimate hope was to die in order that <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> might awaken to a new life.</p>

                <p>The next morning <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> spoke affectionately
                    to him, pointing out lightly that he must call upon <persName key="rossiniEl"
                        >Elena</persName> if for no other reason than as an act of courtesy. When
                    there he could always find an excuse if he could not bring himself to visit her
                    German Professor.</p>
                <p>An hour later he was on his way to <placeName>Passy</placeName>, where <persName
                        key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> lived: punctually at twelve o'clock her car
                    stopped in front of the house where the German doctor was staying. While
                        <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> was pulling the bell, <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> whispered: "Perhaps it will turn out quite
                    interesting to see your German celebrity face to face, as he belongs to a race
                    in whom interest in scientific investigation is so strongly pronounced that this
                    interestâ€”"</p>
                <p>"For heaven's sake," interrupted <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>,
                    "don't start delivering a lecture on the doorstep."</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> seized his friend's hand. "<persName
                        key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, I only mean . . . I only hope . . . How
                    shall I express it?"</p>
                <p><persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> looked very seriously at her friend,
                    who was pale with excitement. "Go on, <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>."</p>
                <p>And then he blurted out: ". . . That he will not regard me merely as a sorry
                    renegade . . . because . . . I would rather be a woman than a man."</p>
                <p>"No, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, I will answer for that."</p>
                <p>Footsteps were heard inside the house.</p>
                <p>The door was opened and a servant received</p>

                <p>them; but before he had found time to announce them a tall, thin gentleman
                    advanced to meet them. A dark-blue <hi rend="italic">sakkoanzug</hi>* emphasized
                    the austere elegance of his appearance in an almost military manner. His hair,
                    which was brushed in a smooth mass across his high forehead, was dark, while his
                    small moustache, trimmed in American style, was of a light fair colour.</p>
                <p>When <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> later on tried to recall these
                    features to memory his mind was a mere blank every time. From those blue,
                    deep-set eyes, which were bright and dark at the same time, radiated a strange,
                    captivating charm.</p>
                <p>It was <persName>Werner Kreutz</persName>.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> felt his heart beat faster. While
                    the <persName>Professor</persName> was conducting them with a somewhat
                    ceremonious cordiality into the drawing-room, exchanging the while a few words
                    with <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, it occurred to <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> for the first time in his life that German
                    was a beautiful and musical language.</p>
                <p>As in a dream he listened to the conversation between the two, even when
                        <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> was telling the
                        <persName>Professor</persName> about him and his doleful story, throwing him
                    now and again, as if accidentally, a quick, affectionate glance.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> could think of nothing, and was
                    conscious of nothing but the doctor's voice. It was as if he were laid under a
                    spell, the spell of this voice. It reminded him of the
                        <persName>Professor</persName>'s eyes; it, too, was light and dark at the
                    same time. Both the eyes and the voice penetrated into the innermost recesses of
                    his soul.</p>
                <p>And what would this voice have to say to him?</p>
                <p>*Frock-coat.</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>And these eyes, what would their glance announce to him?</p>
                <p>A death sentence? Did he expect anything other than this? Did he expect anything
                    at all? Had he come here for any definite purpose?</p>
                <p>The <persName>Professor</persName> stood in front of him, hardly looked at him,
                    and spoke only a few brief words to him. And <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> followed the professor into an anteroom, where he was
                    told to undress. "Now I feel like a sleepwalker," thought <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> in a vague and remote manner. He must
                    obey, without questioning. He wanted to say something, and fumbled for German
                    words.</p>
                <p>"You need not give me any explanations, sir," the <persName>Professor</persName>
                    interrupted him considerately.</p>
                <p>"It hurts here, doesn't it, and there, and likewise there, doesn't it?" And his
                    hand slowly glided over <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' body. All
                    that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> needed to do was to nod quickly
                    and shyly. An almost terrifying astonishment gripped him. How did this strange
                    man know where his pains were located?</p>
                <p>And this astonishment grew into amazement when the
                    <persName>Professor</persName>, to whom <persName key="rossiniEl"
                        >Elena</persName> had handed a bundle of photographs of <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, took the portraits out of the envelope and
                    laid them on the table in the order of the years marked on their backs, which
                    the <persName>Professor</persName> had not observed.</p>
                <p>"There we have the development clearly marked," said the
                        <persName>Professor</persName> bluntly. <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> did not even nod.</p>

                    excitement. Everything was going round.</p>
                <p>"Extremely probable," replied the <persName>Professor</persName>, imperturbable
                    and positive; yet the sound of his voice seemed slightly muffled, very soft and
                    discreet. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was to be reminded
                    continually of this lightly veiled voice, and not merely <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. "For I think you possess both male and
                    female organs, and that neither of them has sufficient room to develop properly.
                    It is fortunate for you that you have such a pronounced feminine feeling. That's
                    why I think I shall be able to help you."</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had to clutch at his heart. He
                    leaned over, in order not to miss a single word that fell from the lips of this
                    amazing man. He stared fixedly at him, expecting to find confirmation of his
                    words in his glance.</p>
                <p>"Well, <persName>Professor</persName>, what am I? . . . What . . . ?"</p>
                <p>The <persName>Professor</persName> rose, paced up and down the room for a while
                    as if to think the matter over, and then turned to <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> again. And once more <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> drank in his words.</p>
                <p>"Come to me in <placeName>Germany</placeName>. I hope I shall be able to give you
                    a new life and a new youth." </p>
                <p>These words were uttered with extreme simplicity. </p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> stood up and struggled for speech. </p>
                <p>"Then it will be <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> who survives?"</p>
                <p>"Yes," answered <persName>Werner Kreutz</persName>. "I will operate on you, and
                    give you new and strong ovaries.</p>

                <p>This operation will remove the stoppage in your development which occurred at the
                    age of puberty. But first of all you will have to undergo various treatment of a
                    preliminary nature in <placeName>Berlin</placeName>. Then you can come to me in
                        <placeName>Dresden</placeName>."</p>
                <p>With these words ended the serious and fateful conversation between the strange
                    man and <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, who was still sitting a
                    little breathless when the <persName>Professor</persName> brought <persName
                        key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> into his consulting-room. And she smiled to
                    conceal her emotion.</p>
                <p>The doctor stood apart from them thoughtfully, and looked suddenly at <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and then at <persName key="rossiniEl"
                        >Elena</persName>. "May I speak quite openly?" he said, glancing from one to
                    the other.</p>
                <p>"Please do," replied <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. "I have no
                    secrets from <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>."</p>
                <p>"Well, then," began the <persName>Professor</persName>, "I hear that you are
                    married."</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> blushed with embarrassment.</p>
                <p>"Your marriage . . . perhaps you can tell me something about it, because, as a
                    doctor, at any rate . . ."</p>
                <p>Each of them was conscious of something fantastic at this moment, although the
                    question seemed the most natural thing in the world.</p>
                <p>"Perhaps I had better go," suggested <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>,
                    full of solicitude for her friend.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> caught hold of her. "No, <persName
                        key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, no, don't go."</p>
                <p>The <persName>Professor</persName> came to the assistance of both. His smile
                    worked at this moment like a deliverance. "What is the attitude, for instance,
                    ofâ€”I thought I heard the name <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> just
                    nowâ€”well, of <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, towards men? I mean, do
                    men interest <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>?" </p>

                <p>"Yes, indeed," laughed <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>; "it is
                    positively incredible what an attraction <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> has for the other sex."</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> attempted to interrupt her. The
                        <persName>Professor</persName> was now laughing heartily.</p>
                <p>"Let the lady go on, please." And <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had
                    perforce to listen while she continued: "I have seen it with my own eyes at
                    various carnivals and balls." </p>
                <p>The <persName>Professor</persName> became serious again. "What you have just told
                    me, madam, is all of a piece with the picture I have formed in my own mind. . .
                    . For the rest, the operation which has become necessary, especially as it is
                    the first of its kind, will create a number of remarkable situations, not least,
                    from a legal point of view. But"â€”and with this he came close to <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and took his handâ€”"I promise you I will
                    not leave <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> in the lurch and that I will
                    assist her with her first independent steps into life." </p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> looked down at the stranger's hand.
                    He did not know what he ought to do. He looked helplessly around the room, then
                    released the doctor's hand and stretched out both arms to <persName
                        key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, as if imploring help. She hurried to him
                    and embraced him maternally.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>," he stammered through his tears,
                    "the life which is now coming with which I shall have nothing whatever to do . .
                    . this life, <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, you have saved. Without

                <p><persName>Werner Kreutz</persName> was standing in front of the window, looking
                    silently into the street.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> went towards him, weeping. The
                        <persName>Professor</persName> took his hands and said quietly: "I

                <p>For hours <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had been waiting in the
                    little studio for her husband's return.</p>
                <p>When at last he entered, he was as pale as death. <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> hurried to him. She led him to the sofa, upon which he
                    collapsed helplessly. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> remained
                    sitting by him for a long time without saying a word.</p>
                <p>When at length <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> began to speak, she
                    listened to him with closed eyes, and <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> too spoke with closed eyes. How much of it all was a
                    dream? And how much reality? Did that which was then beginning mean redemption,
                        <hi rend="italic">the</hi> redemption? Whither led the way for him, for her,
                    for both?</p>
                <p>And <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, completely upset by all that he
                    had just experienced, told his story in broken words.</p>
                <p>At length he rose to his feet. Without a word he took <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>'s hands and led her to the easel in front of the broad
                    window, through which the northern sky was lighting up the room. A large picture
                    was leaning against the easel, upon which three female figures were to be seen.
                    One of the women bore <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s features,
                    another bore <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>'s features, and the

                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>," he then said, "be thankful that

                <p>On the evening of this fateful day <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>

                <p>Not until then did he dare to acknowledge to himself how great his torment and

                <!--<p style="letter">-->
                <p>"Dear <persName key="brotherChris">Christian</persName>,</p>
                <p>"You have not heard from me for a long time, because I have been able to tell you
                    nothing good about <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. From time to time I
                    have been examined by several doctors, but without result. Throughout they
                    prescribed sedative remedies, which left me no better nor wiser than I was
                    before. For I want to know what is happening to me, even if it hurts. After
                    consulting with <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, <persName
                        key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> took me to one of her personal
                    acquaintances, who received me three hours before he was leaving
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName>. Then something happened which sounds almost
                    like a miracle! I had a consultation with the famous surgeon and woman's doctor
                    Professor <persName>Werner Kreutz</persName>,</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>of <placeName>Dresden</placeName>. Strangely enough, he resembled you. He
                    examined me a long time, and then declared that my case was so rare that only
                    one similar case had been known up till now. He added that in the condition in
                    which I am at present, I could hardly be regarded as a living creature, because
                    the ray treatment had been a great mistake, especially as it had not been
                    preceded by microscopical examination. Now he fears that this treatment in the
                    dark may have destroyed my organsâ€”male as well as female. Consequently, he wants
                    me to go to <placeName>Berlin</placeName> as quickly as possible for the purpose
                    of a microscopical examination.</p>
                <p>"<hi rend="italic">Some time afterwards he will operate on me himself</hi>. He
                    wants to remove the dead (and formerly imperfect) male organs, and to restore
                    the female organs with new and fresh material. <hi rend="italic">Then it will be
                            <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> who will survive</hi></p>
                <p>"Her weak girl's body will then be able to develop, and she will feel as young as
                    her new and fresh organs. Dear <persName key="brotherChris"
                    >Christian</persName>, I am now sitting here and weeping like a child while I am
                    writing you these lines. It seems so like a miracle that I dare not believe it.
                    One thing, however, consoles meâ€”that were it otherwise I must soon die.
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and I believe we are dreaming,
                    and are fearful of waking. It is too wonderful to think that <persName

                    the happiest girl in the worldâ€”and that this ghastly nightmare of my life is
                    drawing to an end. This wretched comedy as a man! Without <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> I should have thrown up the sponge long
                    ago. But in these dark days I have</p>

                <p>had a fresh opportunity of seeing what a splendid girl she is . . . she is an
                    angel. Over-exertions, her own sufferings, have left her unscathed. She has
                    contrived to work for two, now that I am no longer worth much. I do what I am
                    able, of course, and have exhibited and sold with success in all the important
                    Salons. But now all this is over. I am no longer fit for anything. I am like a
                    wretched grub which is waiting to become a butterfly. The operation is urgent,
                    and the doctor would like me to proceed to <placeName>Berlin</placeName>
                    immediately, as some twenty days must elapse between the first examination and
                    the operation. And I must be in <placeName>Dresden</placeName> on the day he is
                    ready to create <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. He will send me
                    medicine, which I am to take, in order to support the internal organs and
                    thereby keep me alive until then. For practical reasons I begged for some delay,
                    and I told him that I should prefer so to arrange matters as to proceed to
                        <placeName>Berlin</placeName> via <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName>, as I
                    wanted first to hold an exhibition in <placeName>Denmark</placeName>. I would
                    then proceed from <placeName>Berlin</placeName> to
                        <placeName>Dresden</placeName> at the beginning of April.</p>
                <p>"This does not particularly please the doctor; but he understood that I had
                    suggested this for practical reasons.</p>
                <p>"Now, I do not know whether it is due to excitement, but my condition has
                    worsened to such an extent that I no longer feel able to make preparations for
                    an exhibition and attend to everything it involvesâ€”I realize that I have no time
                    to lose.</p>

                    estimate their value to be between 7,000 and 10,000 kronen. I do not, however,
                    know what the operation will cost, but I estimate it will come to between 4,000
                    and 5,000 kronen in all. I give you all these pictures in

                    and in any event. If the affair turns out badly, the pictures can be sold, and
                    if it turns out well, we can soon repay you the money. Our earning powers are

                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> breathed again; he began to summon
                    up new courage.</p>
                <p><persName>Werner Kreutz</persName> had promised to send him early news, the
                    signal to strike his tent.</p>
                <p>One evening he said to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>: "I often find
                    myself thinking of my old schoolmaster now. He used to tell us the story of the
                    negroes of <placeName>Saint Croix</placeName>, who broke out into revolt a day
                    before their emancipation from slavery. Now I understand their feelings. I feel
                    I can wait no longer."</p>
                <p>A few days later, on a Monday morning, <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>
                    received a telegram from a friend in <placeName>Berlin</placeName> directing
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> to arrive in
                        <placeName>Berlin</placeName> not later than the following Saturday and to
                    stay at a specified hotel, which the <persName>Professor</persName> frequented
                    during his visits to <placeName>Berlin</placeName>. A letter would be awaiting
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> in the hotel.</p>
                <p>Two days later <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was on his way to

                        >Elena</persName> accompanied him to the train.</p>
                <p>Since the arrival of the telegram he had scarcely uttered a word. He seemed like
                    a man living in a dream. Every joy and every sorrow he shut up in his heart.
                    Even at the moment of farewell he scarcely betrayed any excitement. To be alone
                    . . . to get away . . . fleeing towards a new fate . . . fleeing from past and
                    future . . . andâ€”to refrain from thinking until the goal was reached. . . . What

                <p>The train moved slowly away. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had a
                    seat by the window.</p>
                <p>Out of old habit he had lit a cigarette. One after another he smoked. . . . From
                    time to time he mechanically flicked off the ashes.</p>
                <p>He was a prey to that complete mental lassitude which so frequently supervenes
                    upon hasty travel preparations the moment the traveller suddenly finds himself
                    alone in the departing train.</p>
                <p>Horrible ideas assailed him when he suddenly realized that he had now surrendered
                    himself. He fell into a fever of apprehension.</p>
                <p>Suddenly he had a vision of the two beloved faces. <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> . . . <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> . . . and
                    gradually the two faces changed into one. . . .He had only one name for them
                    both: home, and now, it occurred to him, <placeName>Paris</placeName>.</p>
                <p>He looked out, as if he were seeking them: <placeName>Paris</placeName> . . .
                        <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> . . . <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>.</p>
                <p>When farewells were being said he had not once leaned but of the window. . . .
                    The <placeName>Eiffel Tower</placeName> . . . the mirage in the sky of the
                    towering dome: <placeName>SacrÃ©-CÅ“ur</placeName>. . . <persName key="rossiniEl"

                    had vanished for ever.</p>
                <p>For ever? Yes, for ever! And he, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas
                        Sparre</persName>, would never return to <placeName>Paris</placeName>.</p>
                <p>Perhaps another being. . . . He was unable to pursue the thought to its end.</p>

                    accompanied him, the fugitive. Now he heard it suddenly in the rhythm of the
                    train: fugitive . . . fugitive. . . . </p>
                <p>The train raced through northern <placeName>France</placeName>.</p>
                <p>Across the landscape new townships were springing up out of the ruins. Here and
                    there were vast, strange-looking rectangles with fantastic crops. They were not
                    cornfields: they were fields of crosses, soldiers' cemeteries, plantations of
                    the dead. Cross set close to cross as far as eye could see.</p>
                <p>And he thought of <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. Why had he not
                    allowed her to accompany him? She had implored him to do so. And yet he had
                    forced her to remain behind in <placeName>Paris</placeName> . . . and to wait.
                    He pulled himself together, lit a cigarette, and put the thought out of his
                    mind.</p>
                <p>The train reached the frontier between <placeName>France</placeName> and
                        <placeName>Belgium</placeName>. He gazed indifferently out of the window.
                    The last seat in the compartment was now occupied.</p>
                <p>Through <placeName>Belgium</placeName> the train crawled at a snail's pace.
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> strolled up and down the
                    dining-car and mixed a cocktail. It was not yet six o'clock. The train stopped
                    at every tiny village. Passengers alighted and entered in a leisurely way, as if
                    they had endless time on their hands.</p>
                <p>Then the German frontier was reached, and a new engine imparted new energy to the
                    journey. Slowly the night descended, and soon the train was rushing through the
                    darkness.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>had lingered over his meal in the
                    dining-car and had drunk more wine than usual to deaden his feelings and lull
                    the pain caused him by the</p>

                <p>vibration and rolling of the train. But he must return to his compartment. He
                    could scarcely keep on his feet. At length he sank back in his corner again,
                    clenched his teeth, and closed his eyes. All his bridges were burned. Everything
                    lay behind him. His whole life seemed to him to be something that was past,
                    something that was lost.</p>
                <p>He resolved not to think. But his brain gave him no rest. Would it not perhaps be
                    best to abandon this fantastic experiment? For what it was proposed to do to him
                    was only an experiment after all. Would it not have been more rational to live
                    out his life to the end as it was shaped for him, to let this life ebb away from
                    him?</p>
                <p>He thought of the letter which he had lately written to <persName>Werner
                        Kreutz</persName>:</p>
                <p>"Yours for life and death, provided <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>
                    survives."</p>
                <p>Every particle of masculine pride that dwelt in him stirred and gripped him. "I
                    must reach the goal. I must hold out." He spoke his thoughts half aloud, and
                    several fellow-travellers regarded him inquiringly.</p>
                <p>He had to laugh. . . . Not in vain was he a native of
                        <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName>, where nothing is ever taken
                    seriously.</p>
                <p>"So," said <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> to himself, "let us write
                    our obituary. It's not a matter to be taken tragically."</p>
                <p>And then he began rapidly to compose the sort of notice that would be published,
                    appraising him as artist.</p>
                <p>"The painter <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName> is dead. He died

                <p>fellow-travellers thought he had fallen asleep in one of the corner seats of his
                    compartment. The cause of death was probably a heart attack.</p>
                <p>"A happy and harmonious artistic life here came to an abrupt close. He was a man
                    in the prime of life. After searching for a long time and experimenting in
                    various ways, he seemed to have found his style. His pictures, which mostly
                    originated in <placeName>France</placeName> and <placeName>Italy</placeName>,
                    were sometimes bright and bathed in colour, sometimes dark and somewhat sombre,
                    but always charged with sentiment and natural feeling. Two subjects he preferred
                    above all else: <placeName>Paris</placeName>, whose embankments, bridges, and
                    towers he succeeded, with no little mastery, in reproducing in their lightly
                    veiled pearl-grey atmosphere, and landscapes under lowering skies, showing in
                    vivid lights the trees and houses in the background. It was especially in
                    pictures of the latter kind, these strong, very masculinely conceived storm
                    pictures, that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName> found an
                    outlet for his talent.</p>
                <p>"We, who were acquainted with his soft, often effeminate appearance, and his
                    laughing, joyous tones in conversation, noted this with astonishment, and the
                    thought frequently struck us that whatever masculine force resided in him found
                    its outlet in these strong, somewhat wild and wilful pictures.</p>
                <p>"He painted very quickly, and thus it happened that he found time to devote
                    himself to many other things beside his art. His knowledge was really
                    comprehensive. Very characteristic was an answer which we once heard from his
                    own lips, in the <placeName>Trianon</placeName>, addressed by him to an
                    older</p>
                <pb n="43"/>
                <p><num style="page">38</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>colleague. The latter had expressed his annoyance at the fact that a young
                    colleague was beginning a picture in what he thought was too systematic a way.
                    'You must pardon me if I don't share your view,' retorted <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>, 'but I do believe that it is
                    impossible to paint a leaf of a rose correctly unless one knows the last thing
                    about the influence of Assyrian bas-relief upon the sculpture of the
                    Greeks.'</p>
                <p>"On another occasion he expressed himself in the following way: 'I cannot
                    understand how lightly most of my older colleagues take their artâ€”how easily
                    satisfied they are with their performances. As for me, I calculate I should
                    require a thousand years to become a decent painter.' Thus seriously did
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName> take his art, at any
                    rate.</p>
                <p>"The greater portion of his life he had spent far from his Danish homeâ€”in
                        <placeName>Italy</placeName>, <placeName>Holland</placeName>,
                        <placeName>Germany</placeName>, and <placeName>France</placeName>. He lived
                    mostly in <placeName>Paris</placeName>.</p>
                <p>"The reason why he turned his back in early manhood on
                        <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName>, although his art was highly appreciated
                    there from the beginning, was because <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName> and
                        <placeName>Denmark</placeName> did not seem to him to be the right soil for
                    his wife's art. In <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName> he had frequently been
                    obliged to hear how much his pictures were preferred to those of his wife. And
                    that was perhaps the worst thing that could be said to him. In
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName>, where the contrary was generally the case, he
                    felt at home for this very reason. He felt his wife's successes as his own
                    successes, for his dominant characteristic was chivalry towards his wife, as
                    towards women generally.</p>
                <p>"For the rest, his was a complex, enigmatic</p>
                <pb n="44"/>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">39</num></p>
                <p>nature. Despite the inevitable influences to which every artist in
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName> is exposed, he remained fundamentally a
                    Northern painter, and his art, in its quintessence, had little affinity with
                    Latin, but every affinity with Teutonic influences. His personal outlook was
                    European. He maintained a constant intercourse with French philosophers and
                    writers, with Polish violinists, with Russian architects, and German
                    painters.</p>
                <p>"In collaboration with a French friend he wrote a book about Northern sagas,
                    which passed through many editions in <placeName>Paris</placeName>. Of this he
                    was not a little proud. And he took pleasure in the fact that through this book
                    he had been the means of opening the eyes of the Latin reading world to the
                    Teutonic world of ideas, an undertaking which in the post-War period (the book
                    appeared in the year 1924) deserves praise as the throwing of an intellectual
                    bridge between the Latin and the Teutonic worlds.</p>
                <p>"Without being himself a practised musician, he cherished a deep love of
                    music.</p>
                <p>"In recent years his health had not been particularly good. He had frequently
                    complained of pains, but always in a restrained and smiling way, so that even
                    the doctors whom he was eventually obliged to consult were misled as to his real
                    condition or were unable to realize the serious state of his health.</p>
                <p>"And now death has so abruptlyâ€”and to the deep sorrow of his many friends near
                    and farâ€” terminated this versatile artistic career, which to all of us who have
                    known him must seem like an unfinished romance. . . ."</p>

                    stop." And he thought that, in much the same language as he had just been using,
                    someone else had secretly written down his career in a diaryâ€”<persName

                    thought that he would die suddenly. One night he had found her asleep over her
                    diary. He was careful not to let <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>

                        <placeName>Cologne</placeName>? he moaned inwardly.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had not booked a sleeping-berth. He
                    did not care for this modern travelling comfort. To be perched aloft with
                    perfect strangers was repellent to his fastidiousness. An unconquerable aversion
                    forbade him to undress in the presence of other men. He had often been chaffed
                    on this account. Only <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> understood his
                    repugnance.</p>
                <p>At last, <placeName>Cologne</placeName>! All his fellow travellers left the
                    compartment. "They have sleeping-berths," thought <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> gleefully. He was left alone.</p>
                <p>After a short time the train started again. <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> lit a fresh cigarette. Would the pain leave him in peace
                    until he reached his destination, <placeName>Berlin</placeName>? If he could
                    only sleep just this one night! If he could only banish thought for just this
                    one night!</p>
                <p>He took off his coat and laid it under his head, so that he might lie higher, and
                    wrapped himself in his cloak. Before he had felt too hot . . . now he began to
                    shiver. He rose from his seat, drew down the curtains in front of the windows,
                    and switched off the light. Then he laid down again.</p>
                <p>The pains racked him afresh. He drew his cloak over his face.</p>

                <p>Then he fell asleep, and slept for several hours.</p>
                <p>"<placeName>Hanover!</placeName> . . . <placeName>Hanover!</placeName>" the
                    porters were shouting, And then again, a long way off:
                        "<placeName>Hanover</placeName>!"</p>
                <p>The sound of hammers was heard tapping the wheels, coming nearer and nearer.
                    Doors were flung open and slammed.</p>
                <p>A shrill whistle blew and slowly the train moved off again.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was half leaning, half lying on the
                    seat in a drowsy state. Suddenly he jumped to his feet. The door of his carriage
                    was flung open. The drawn curtains were pushed aside.</p>
                <p>A lady was standing in front of the door. Her silhouette was sharply defined
                    against the light in the corridor.</p>
                <p>The darkness in his compartment seemed for a moment to intimidate her. But only
                    for a moment. Then she threw a small trunk upon the rack and sank wearily into
                    the nearest empty corner seat, next to the door leading to the corridor.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> switched on the light again.</p>
                <p>He suppressed his ill-humour at being thus suddenly jerked out of his solitude.
                    "The train will not stop again until it reaches <placeName>Berlin</placeName>,"
                    he thought, "and so there is no hope of being alone again." Should he move into
                    the adjoining compartment? Perhaps it was empty. But he immediately rejected the
                    idea. He could not hurt the lady's feelings by appearing discourteous.</p>
                <p>He sat up straight in his seat, and observed his companion without her noticing
                    it.</p>
                <p>What struck him was the expression of her eyes. She did not seem to be seeing him
                    at all; she did</p>

                <p>not seem to be aware that she was sharing the tiny compartment with a man.</p>
                <p>He looked in front of him. He stared at his fingers. But his eyes were soon fixed
                    on her again, and he noted with astonishment that she was weeping.</p>
                <p>The tears were starting from her eyes. She must have seen that he was looking at
                    her; but in spite of this she did not make the least attempt to hide her weeping
                    or dry her tears.</p>
                <p>She was obviously quite young. Plaits of fair hair framed a smooth, narrow,
                    girlish forehead. Her eyes, dimmed with tears, were bright blue and at other
                    times could sparkle with gaiety. She had removed her gloves. He noticed a plain
                    ring on a finger of her left hand. She was a bride, then.</p>
                <p>Profound sympathy stirred in him.</p>
                <p>"Mademoiselle . . ." he began.</p>
                <p>She did not seem to hear him. Probably he had spoken too softly, or the roar of
                    the train had drowned his words.</p>
                <p>Then it occurred to him that he was now in <placeName>Germany</placeName>.</p>
                <p>"GnÃ¤diges FrÃ¤ulein . . ." he repeated, almost embarrassed.</p>
                <p>She raised her weeping eyes. "What an enchanting bride!" thought <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>.</p>
                <p>"I should like so much to help you," he said. "You seem to be in great trouble. .
                    . ."</p>
                <p>He could get no further. She covered her face with her hands and wept as if her
                    heart would break. Then, between her sobs, she handed him a folded newspaper,
                    which she had been hugging the whole time. Only then did <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> notice it. He</p>

                <p>took the paper, but did not know what to do with it. He rose from his seat and
                    sat beside the weeping girl and stroked her hand. She became calmer.</p>
                <p>It appeared that her husband, a well-known musician, had gone to
                        <placeName>Berlin</placeName> two days before in order to give a concert in
                    that city. This very evening he had been expected to return. On the way to the
                    station to meet him, she had chanced to buy a newspaper, <hi rend="italic"
                        >the</hi> newspaper which <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was
                    now holding in his hand, and in it she had read . . .</p>
                <p>She pointed to the place on the front page and wept again.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> read:</p>
                <p>The young pianist XX of <placeName>Hanover</placeName>, who gave a successful
                    concert yesterday evening in the XX hall, met with an accident on the way to his
                    hotel, his taxi-cab colliding with a tramcar. He is now lying in hospital with
                    very serious injuries. His condition gives rise to the gravest anxiety. </p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was shocked when he read the report.
                    He had offered his help to the unhappy bride. Now he felt like an idle
                    chatterer.</p>
                <p>And yet, little as he had ever been able to help himself, in the case of others
                    he had frequently been able to alleviate pain by means of a mystic force which
                    appeared to dwell in him. How often had not <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> and <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> assured him
                    of this?</p>
                <p>The young lady's feverish hands were now lying in his. He clasped them tightly
                    for a long time. At first she quivered like a captive bird. Then the quivering
                    grew less and less. He did not utter a word; he merely stroked very softly the
                    limp, girlish hands. She too was silent. He could hear her</p>

                <p>gentle breathing, and then her breathing became more and more regular. Her head
                    sank on his shoulder, and she fell asleep. Now her heart was beating softly
                    against his hand, which he had been obliged to place around her to afford her
                    support.</p>
                <p>And he smiled happily at the thought that something of that hidden enigmatic
                    force was still left in him to-day.</p>
                <p>More than once he tried to move; but each time his companion trembled like a sick
                    child, whimpering in slumber. He therefore remained sitting in a rigid position.
                    And gradually the roar of the train rocked him lightly to sleep also.</p>
                <p>It was not long before he awoke, and the thought of his position forced a smile
                    to his lips.</p>
                <p>Here he was now sitting, he, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>,
                    of <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName>, whom life had drifted to
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName>, and who was now being driven northward by a
                    fantastic destiny, overwhelmed with his own grief and needing help and
                    assistance if ever a person did, and chance had selected just him to give
                    consolation to a perfect stranger, to help her over a dark hour of her
                    existenceâ€”perhaps her darkest hour. And here was this little German lady, the
                    wife of an unknown man, lying in his arms. And she and he, each of them, were
                    journeying, guided by by some blind providence, towards their own fates . . .
                    somewhere in <placeName>Germany</placeName>.</p>
                <p>These were the thoughts that kept running through his mind.</p>
                <p>And then a few secret tears splashed down his cheeks, and it suddenly dawned upon
                    him why all this had so happened. This charming creature from
                        <placeName>Hanover</placeName>, who was now slumbering</p>

                <p>in his arms like a blissfully confiding child, had been sent him as the last
                    woman towards whom he could act as a protective maleâ€”before parting for ever
                    from woman, from the eternal-feminine.</p>
                <p>So his thoughts assumed these vague shapes, while on the other side of the window
                    a foggy morning was dawning, and the train was rushing through the sea of houses
                    which constituted <placeName>Berlin</placeName>.</p>
                <p>He realized that he must awaken his travelling companion.</p>
                <p>With a shriek of anguish she started out of her sleep, and gazed at him in utter
                    perplexity. "Oh, he can't be dead!" Her words again dissolved in tears.</p>
                <p>"Child," he said, speaking in a soft and confident voice, "child, I do not know
                    your name, and you do not know mine, but please believe me when I say that I
                    know he is alive."</p>
                <p>She seized both his hands and covered them with kisses.</p>
                <p>"Yes, indeed," he assured her, "make your mind quite easy."</p>
                <p>"Oh, I am quite at ease! How you have helped me! I shall never forget what you
                    have done."</p>
                <p>A few minutes later she was lost in the crowd of people on the platform.
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> gazed after her for a long time.
                    The newspaper which she had given him during the night was the only memento
                    which he retained.</p>
                <p>A few days later <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> happened to read in
                    a newspaper that the husband of his unknown travelling companion was on the road
                    to recovery.</p>

                <p>In the company of a porter <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> walked the
                    short distance from the station to the hotel. </p>
                <p>"How devilish cold it is here in <placeName>Berlin</placeName>, although it is
                    the first of March!" he confided in a tone of surprise to the man who was
                    carrying his two trunks. "In <placeName>Paris</placeName> it is already spring." </p>
                <p>"Yes, in <placeName>Paris</placeName>," replied the honest fellow, "in
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName>." And this ended the conversation.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> turned up his collar. His teeth were
                    really chattering. He was exhausted after passing an almost sleepless night and
                    plunging into the midst of a strange world. But the unexpected coldness of the
                    temperature kept his senses fully alert.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, before he reached the neighbouring hotel, the thought struck him:
                    "These two trunks contain my very last articles of clothing, shirts, collars. .
                    . . How absurd!"</p>
                <p>A feeling of defiance welled up in him, as if the <hi rend="italic">man</hi> were
                    at bay, the man within him.</p>
                <p>In the hotel, where the manager had been advised of his arrival, he was treated
                    with exquisite courtesy. He immediately inquired whether <persName>Professor
                        Kreutz</persName>, who was in the habit of staying in this hotel almost
                    every week-end, had perchance already arrived. He was disappointed to learn that
                    this was not so, nor had any letter been left for him with the porter.</p>

                <p>A few minutes later he went to his room. He took a warm bath, and by the time he
                    had breakfasted all his troubles were forgotten.</p>
                <p><persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>'s woman friend, the sender of the
                    fateful telegram which had prompted his journey to
                    <placeName>Berlin</placeName>, soon rang him up.</p>
                <p>"Welcome to <placeName>Berlin</placeName>," her voice sounded over the telephone.
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> immediately recognized the voice
                    of <persName key="schildtBar">Baroness Schildt</persName>, whom he had met in
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName> on a number of occasions with <persName

                <p>"We have everything ready. And so that no time may be lost, some specialists whom

                <p>And scarcely had this visit been arranged than the telephone rang again.

                    and early this morning an express letter from her followed. The letter has
                    therefore been racing you. You must come and see us at once.
                        <persName>Inger</persName> and I will keep the morning coffee hot until you
                    arrive."</p>
                <p>An address and directions were hastily written down. A few minutes afterwards
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was on his way, and half an hour
                    later he was in his friend's house.</p>

                <p>A splendid fellow, this <persName>Niels</persName>â€”a blond giant from
                        <placeName>North Jutland</placeName>, where his family were old landed
                    proprietors.</p>
                <p><persName>Inger</persName>, his wife, was the type of the modern cultivated
                    woman. Henna-red hair contrasted piquantly with her large blue eyes. Both were
                    globe-trotters. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had often undertaken long journeys with
                    them together. Intimate as they had all been with one another, however,
                        <persName>Niels</persName> and his wife had hitherto been unaware of
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' secret.</p>
                <p>He was received most cordially. They had breakfast and spoke about indifferent
                    subjects as long as <persName>Inger</persName> was in the room. Then
                        <persName>Niels</persName> blurted out:</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> has told me something which I can't
                    quite understand in this letter which came early this morning. You can, of
                    course, read it."</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> retorted. "No; the letter is
                    addressed to you."</p>
                <p>On the walls of the room hung a few pictures, painted by <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and by <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>. Involuntarily <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> looked up at them. The first picture, painted by
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, wasâ€”<persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>.</p>
                <p>"Yes," said <persName>Niels</persName> delicately, "now I understand a good deal
                    of what used to seem like a fantastic idea about you bothâ€”seeing you crop up so
                    often as a female model in <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s
                    pictures."</p>
                <p>A brief silence followed this remark.</p>
                <p>"Well, old fellow," resumed <persName>Niels</persName>, "some hints which
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> let fall about you a year ago in
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName> showed me then that your life appeared to be
                    taking a strange turn. Whether the change that is now in store for you is a

                <p>one, you can be assured of thisâ€”that you have entrusted your fate here to the
                    best and most conscientious hands. Everything now depends upon whether you will
                    have the strength to go through with it. You seem tired. But"â€”and
                        <persName>Niels</persName> laughed merrilyâ€”"it really is a most
                    extraordinary thing for a man to be faced with the choice of whether he will
                    survive in this world of multiplying sensations as <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>, or"â€”and then he pointed to the pictureâ€”"as <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>."</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> looked hard at his friend. "Faced
                    with the choice, you say. . . . No, I do not think it is a question of that, but
                    of something much more serious, of life or death, in fact; for believe me, the
                    man you are talking to is condemned to death. And now the question is, whether
                    that <hi rend="italic">being</hi> there"â€”and he pointed to the portraitâ€”"can be
                    summoned into existence and take up the battle of life."</p>
                <p><persName>Niels</persName> now spoke very seriously. "Yes, and what seems to be
                    the most important thing at the moment is that you should be perfectly clear in
                    your own mind how this strange, fantastic change which you have been undergoing
                    from childhood until nowâ€”that is, during a normal human lifeâ€”has been
                    proceeding; in what gradual manner, therefore, <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> has been gaining the upper hand over <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>."</p>
                <p>"That is so," replied <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, looking at his
                    watch; "but now I must be off to my first arbiter of life and death, to
                        <persName key="arns">Professor Arns</persName>. And when I have finished
                    with him I must probably go further . . . through the whole round."</p>
                <p>"Agreed," laughed <persName>Niels</persName> jovially; "and when</p>

                    nothing!"</p>
                <p>. . . . .</p>
                <p><persName key="arns">Professor Arns</persName>, the inventor of a new method of
                    blood-testing, received <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> in a very
                    considerate manner. He put a series of questions which, although of a delicate
                    nature, were answered by <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> without the
                    least hesitation.</p>
                <p>During the long and elaborate examinationsâ€” (the main thing was to determine the
                    vital condition of <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> in <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> by an analysis of his blood)â€”<persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> exerted all his will-power to exclude
                    thought. The doctor conducted him from the study into a comfortably furnished
                    room. "If you would like to smoke, please do so," he said. After chatting for a
                    short time about unimportant things, <persName key="arns">Professor
                        Arns</persName> intimated to his patient that he must now submit himself for
                    a special examination by his friend <persName>Dr. Hardenfeld</persName>, the
                    sexual psychologist. "My colleague <persName>Hardenfeld</persName> has had so
                    much experience in the more 'emotional' sphereâ€”whatever we may think of this
                    from the scientific standpointâ€”that I, at any rate, cannot ignore his opinion in
                    what may so specially affect your person. When they have dismissed you there,
                    you will have to go to <persName>Dr. Karner</persName>, another colleague. He
                    and I, in fact, have to determine the hormone content of your blood, while
                    colleague <persName>Hardenfeld</persName> has to pronounce a purely
                    psychological opinion upon you and the person in you whom you call <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. In any case I shall be glad if you will call
                    on me again to-morrow morning. The result of these various 'tests' to which we
                    have to subject you</p>

                <p><num style="page">51</num></p>
                <p>will then be forwarded to your protector, <persName>Professor
                    Kreutz</persName>."</p>
                <p>"Your protector." . . . These words made <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' heart beat faster, and when, shortly afterwards, he was
                    sitting in a waiting-room of the spacious <placeName>Institute for
                        Psychiatry</placeName>, he was obliged to keep repeating these two words to
                    himselfâ€”otherwise all his courage would have oozed away. "Why have I been sent
                    here?" he wondered. "What have I to do here?" He felt intensely uncomfortable.
                    In this large room a group of abnormal persons seemed to be holding a
                    meetingâ€”women who appeared to be dressed up as men, and men of whom one could
                    scarcely believe that they were men. The manner in which they were conversing
                    disgusted him; their movements, their voices, the way in which they were
                    attired, produced a feeling of nausea.</p>
                <p>At length <persName>Dr. Hardenfeld</persName> appeared and ushered him into his
                    consulting-room. By means of a thousand penetrating questions, this man explored
                    the patient's emotional life for hours. <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> had to submit to an inquisition of the most ruthless
                    kind. The shame of shamelessness is something that actually exists, he thought,
                    during these hours, and clung to this definition, which he had once found in
                    some philosophical work, in an effort to banish the feeling he had of standing
                    there as if in the pillory. His emotional life was undergoing an ordeal which
                    resembled running the gauntlet.</p>
                <p>And when this torture came at last to an end, the inquisitor dismissed him with
                    the words: "I shall expect you to-morrow morning at the same time."</p>

                <pb n="59"/>
                <p><num style="page">52</num> MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>Then it was <persName>Dr. Karner</persName>'s turn. <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> had by now acquired a sort of routine in answering the
                    questions put to him. This examination took the form of a conversation
                    throughout. Before <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was aware of it,
                    he found himself in the midst of a real "masculine conversation", its theme
                    being the political relations between <placeName>France</placeName> and
                        <placeName>Germany</placeName>. And thus, quite incidentally, the doctor
                    introduced a long, fine syringe into <persName key="sparreAn"
                    >Andreas</persName>' arm, in order to take a blood test.</p>
                <p><persName>Dr. Karner</persName> also dismissed him with the words: "And I will
                    see you again in the morning."</p>
                <p>Exhausted by his ordeal, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> at length
                    made his way to <persName>Niels</persName> and <persName>Inger Hvide</persName>
                    in the evening.</p>
                <p>"No," he exclaimed, "don't ask me anything now. I am not fit to answer questions.
                    Let us rather take a good walk through your <placeName>Babylon on the
                        Spree</placeName> round the <placeName>KurfÃ¼rstendamm</placeName>. I must
                    see men, healthy men."</p>
                <p><persName>Inger</persName> had a previous engagement for the evening; but
                        <persName>Niels</persName> accepted his friend's proposal with alacrity.</p>
                <p>They proceeded first to a Russian restaurant, where they enjoyed a supper of many
                    courses, washed down with several glasses of vodka. Then they sampled German,
                    French, Hungarian, and Spanish wines in bars and cafÃ©s of the most various kind.
                    To the surprise of them both, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> proved
                    a good tippling comrade this evening.</p>
                <p>"Your health, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>!" said
                        <persName>Niels</persName>, who had again remarked his friend's astonishing
                    drinking capacity. "You are really a strange fellow. This evening you are
                    behaving just like a rakeâ€”and to-morrow you will perhaps be insisting that
                    henceforth I must treat you like a lady. When I look at you</p>

                <p><num style="page">53</num></p>
                <p>I can hardly believe that there is not something wonderful about it all. But
                    perhaps from the very beginning not only have two souls dwelt within your breast
                    in the sense of <persName>Goethe</persName>, but two beings, two whole beings. .
                    . . I hardly know how to express myself."</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> regarded him calmly. "I know what
                    you are trying to get at. It is difficult to make head or tail of this change,
                    difficult for me, but much more difficult for others. And the strangest thing of
                    all, believe me, is that each of the beings within me is healthy and perfectly
                    normal in its emotional life."</p>
                <p>"And it is just that which is perhaps the abnormal and incredible thing about
                    your case," declared <persName>Neils</persName>. "I have known you for years, I
                    mean"â€”and then he laughed slightlyâ€”"as <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>, for you have been silent about <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> to us friends. And as a man you have always seemed to me
                    unquestionably healthy. I have, indeed, seen with my own eyes that you attract
                    women, and that is the clearest proof that you are a genuine fellow." He paused,
                    and then placed his hand on <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>'
                    shoulder. "You won't take it amiss if I ask you a frank question?"</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> stared at him.
                        "<persName>Niels</persName>, if you knew what kind of questions I have had
                    to answer today you would not behave so solemnly about the matter."</p>
                <p>"Well, then, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, have you at any time
                    been interested in your own kind? You know what I mean."</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> shook his head calmly. "My word on

                <p>"Good, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>! That's just what I thought." </p>
                <p>"I will honestly and plainly confess to you, <persName>Niels</persName>, that I
                    have always been attracted to women. And to-day as much as ever. A most banal
                    confession!"</p>
                <p><persName>Niels</persName> raised his glass. "And now we will drink to the
                    future. Let come what may! Go right through with it! If you had lived in the

                    to-day doctors are, at any rate, permitted to accomplish something like a

                <p>They drank the toast.</p>
                <p><persName>Niels</persName> accompanied his friend to his hotel. When <persName

                <p>"Yes; as you said, the most important thing at the moment is for me to be
                    perfectly clear in my own mindâ€”I am using your own wordsâ€”how this strange,

                    And in order that you may perfectly understand this, and supposing that you both
                    have as much patience as I have, I propose relating in detail how all this has
                    happened. . . . I have made a few notes, so as not to lose the thread of my

                <p><persName>Niels</persName> rose to his feet, paced up and down a few times, and

                    He too had now become serious.</p>
                <p>"I thought it would be something like that. And as you know me to be a

                <p>"Then fire away!" With these words <persName>Niels</persName> settled himself in
                    an armchair, and produced a pencil and notebook. <persName>Inger</persName>
                    reclined on the sofa and smoked her cigarette.</p>

                    I have my dark eyes. He was not a man of bracing character, but rather
                    effeminate, much concerned with himself and his own comfort.
                        <persName>Mother</persName>, on the other hand, was a hale woman, with
                    healthy nerves, a Nordic blonde type, perhaps even somewhat hard in her
                    temperament, an efficient housewife and a good mother. She died before <persName

                        >Father</persName> was inconsolable. Their marriage had survived many
                    storms. After <persName>Mother</persName>'s death he revered her like a
                    saint.</p>
                <p>"She had four children, three sons and one daughter; I being the youngest.</p>
                <p>"I was a very happy child. Everybody pampered me, even my

                    Whenever a slap was necessary, it was administered by

                    clad finely enough for her. Sometimes I was not allowed to romp about with my
                    playmates on account of my 'best clothes', and this was the greatest distress I
                    had to endure.</p>

                <p>As a little chap I had long, fair locks, snow-white skin, and dark eyes, so that
                    strangers often took me for a girl. In a kindergarten, where, as the only boy, I
                    played with eleven girls, I was the cleverest of all the children in knitting
                    and embroidery. As a five-year-old, at the annual prize-giving of our
                    kindergarten I received my first mark of public distinction for fancy-work.</p>
                <p>"As an eight-year-old my two <persName key="brotherPlur">brothers</persName>
                    often bantered me on account of my 'girl's voice'. I took this very much to
                    heart, and thereafter made great efforts to acquire a proper youthful bass.</p>
                <p>"Looking back on things now, it seems as if my childish voice was my first
                    dissimulation.</p>
                <p>"In other respects my childhood was nothing but sunshine. With my <persName
                        key="brotherPlur">brothers</persName>
                    <!-- brothersPlur -->I played with tin soldiers, with my
                        <persName>sister</persName> with dolls. No one saw anything strange in the
                    fact that I was fond of pushing my <persName>sister</persName>'s toy
                    perambulator, as many brothers who have sisters do this.</p>
                <p>"At nine years of age I went to the same grammar school as my <persName
                        key="brotherPlur">brothers</persName>
                    <!-- brothersPlur -->. None of us was a model pupil. My favourite subjects were
                    French and Latin, but I was also one of the most assiduous users of the school
                    library, which gave me a high place in our headmaster's opinion. Nevertheless, I
                    was usually the last but one in the class. The old man himself taught us French.
                    He spoke the language correctly, with an excellent accent. Once during the
                    summer holidays he went to <placeName>Paris</placeName>, and afterwards he told
                    us wrathfully that he did not think much of the Parisians, as they neither
                    understood him nor he understood them, ending his anecdote with the words:
                    'And</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>now you know, boys, that I can speak French. He was a droll chap.</p>
                <p>"Of a different stamp was my Latin teacher. He was a most enlightened man, who
                    not only taught us Latin grammar, but took great pains to familiarize us with
                    the intellectual atmosphere of antiquity and the art of the ancients. He it was
                    who first opened my eyes to the flawless beauty of Greek sculpture. It was only
                    a vague and remote comprehension. But I can remember as if it were yesterday,
                    when bathing with boys of my own age I would often blush at seeing my own
                    somewhat slim and delicate youthful body reflected in the water beside the
                    sturdy and not particularly well-proportioned youthful bodies of the others. I
                    was really built on much more delicate and flexible lines than were my comrades.
                    Then I would think of the youthful figures of Praxiteles, about which the Latin
                    master had been telling us a few days before. In the art-room we had also a few
                    plaster casts.</p>
                <p>"This reminds me of a little scene. At that time a number of girls were attending
                    our school. One of them attended the same classes as I. Once â€”during the
                    intervalâ€”she put her hat on my head for fun. 'Doesn't he look like a proper
                    girl?' she cried, and my comrades laughed with me. Suddenly our Latin master
                    stood in front of us. I was too frightened to take off the girl's hat in time,
                    and before I knew what was happening I had received a sound thrashing. I was
                    then in a perfect rage, and did not realize until many years later why my old
                    teacher had then felt it his duty to punish me. We poor humans . . . what do
                    we</p>

                <p>know about ourselves . . . how much less about our neighbours?</p>
                <p>"For the rest I was an ordinary boy. I was in the thick of all fights. Just
                    because I was more delicate than my companions I deliberately displayed special
                    daring. Many bruises were the result of this ambition.</p>
                <p>"Incidentally I went on long walks with my <persName>sister</persName>. And when
                    I knew that no one was likely to see meâ€”as in the wood close to the townâ€”I
                    pushed her doll's pram, which always accompanied us.</p>
                <p>"In adolescence my interest in art constantly increased. When I was seventeen I
                    began to read art periodicals and to visit art exhibitions. My <persName
                        key="father">father</persName>, who, being an old merchant, thought little
                    of an artist's career for me, tried several times to divert my life into a
                    'practical direction'. Thus he apprenticed me first to a merchant and then to a
                    master painter, without achieving anything except to intensify still more my
                    desire to follow an artistic career.</p>
                <p>"At the same time, like every adolescent, I had my 'flame'; indeed, to be honest,
                    I must even speak of 'flames'.</p>
                <p>"When my <persName key="father">father</persName> at length realized that it was
                    hopeless to try to interest me in anything 'practical', I was sent at nineteen
                    years of age to an art academy at <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName>. Here a
                    number of good comrades took me under their wing and took care that I very
                    quickly lost my provincial simplicity and embarrassment and that I also lost my
                    innocence in a thoroughly brutal fashion. Then I met <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>.</p>

                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had just come to the art
                    academy<!-- should this be a placeName?-->. She too was from the provinces. We
                    immediately became inseparable. We attended all the evening lectures together.
                    The ordinary teaching in the academy was at that time so arranged as to divide
                    the sexes.</p>
                <p>"A friend had brought us together.</p>
                <p>"When he learned one day that we were engaged, he became perfectly furious with
                    jealousy, not really on account of <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>,
                    but, and this I only learned many years later, on account of me. But even such a
                    symptom as this is really nothing extraordinary. How many friends have not had
                    similar experiences when a woman has come between them! A year after our first
                    meeting <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and I were married. We were
                    still very youngâ€”I barely twenty, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> two
                    or three years younger. What did we know of life, of people? We were
                    indescribably happy in each other's society.</p>
                <p>"I recollect one evening in the first years of our marriageâ€”we were then living
                    in a studio which commanded a wide view over

                        '<persName>Hermes</persName>, the darling of the gods, had a son, and
                        <persName key="aphrodite">Aphrodite</persName>, the divine beauty, a
                    daughter. The two children were perfect models of beauty. Yet they had never
                    seen each other before when one day they confronted each other in the Wood of
                    the Gods. The girl was immediately enamoured of the boy; but the boy fled from
                    her. However fast she ran after him, he ran faster still. In despair the
                    divine</p>

                <p>maiden turned to <persName>Zeus</persName> and bewailed to him her love torment.
                    "I love him, <persName key="father">father</persName>, but he has fled from me.
                    He will have nothing to do with me. Oh, <persName key="father"
                    >father</persName>, grant that I become one with him." And
                        <persName>Zeus</persName> heard the prayer of the divine child, and he
                    raised his arm, and the next moment the shy son of <persName>Hermes</persName>
                    stood before the Olympian, and <persName key="aphrodite">Aphrodite</persName>'s
                    daughter shouted with glee, embraced the trembling youngsterâ€”and again
                        <persName>Zeus</persName> raised his armâ€”both melted into each other. When
                        <persName>Hermes</persName> and <persName key="aphrodite"
                        >Aphrodite</persName> sought after their children, they found a blissfully
                    smiling divine child. "It is my son!" cried <persName>Hermes</persName>. "No, it
                    is my daughter!" cried <persName key="aphrodite">Aphrodite</persName>. They were
                    both right.</p>
                <p>"'You know,' said <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> to me, 'I love you
                    so much that I should like you and me to be <hi rend="italic">one</hi>
                    being.'</p>
                <p>"About this time <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> painted the portrait
                    of the then popular actress in <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName>, <persName>Anna
                        Larsen</persName>. One day <persName>Anna</persName> was unable to attend
                    the appointed sitting. On the telephone she asked <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>, who was somewhat vexed: 'Cannot <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> pose as a model for the lower part of the picture? His
                    legs and feet are as pretty as mine.'</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> laughed. <persName>Anna
                        Larsen</persName> was aware that once, when <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> was painting a picture of a woman, I had been obliged to
                    come to her assistance with my legs. But it had really only been a question of
                    drapery. 'You really have very pretty woman's legs,' <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> had said to me jokingly.</p>
                <p>"While <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was talking to <persName>Anna
                        Larsen</persName> on the telephone, I had been busy cleaning my palette. I
                    was smoking a cigarette and scarcely</p>
                <pb n="71"/>
                <p><num style="page">64</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>listened when <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> informed me of
                        <persName>Anna Larsen</persName>'s proposal. At first I declined rather
                    shortly. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> chaffed me, abused me,
                    implored me, petted me, and a few minutes later I was standing in the studio in
                    costume and high-heeled shoes. We both laughed as though it were a great joke.
                    And to make the disguise complete, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                    fetched out a carnival wig from the depths of a trunk, a fair, very curly wig,
                    and drew it over my head. Then she attacked me with rouge and powder, while I
                    submitted patiently to everything.</p>
                <p>"When all was ready we could scarcely believe our eyes. I turned round and stared
                    at myself in a mirror again and again, trying to recognize myself. Was it really
                    possible, I asked myself, that I could be so good-looking? <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> clapped her hands delightedly. 'The most
                    perfect ladies' model,' she cried again and again. 'You look just as if you had
                    never worn anything but women's clothes in your life.'</p>
                <p>"And I cannot deny, strange though it may sound, that I enjoyed myself in this
                    disguise. I liked the feel of soft women's clothing; indeed, I seemed to take
                    them as a matter of course. I felt at home in them from the first moment.
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> began to paint.</p>
                <p>"Then a bell rang in the corridor, and a moment later <persName>Anna
                        Larsen</persName> rustled into the studio. She had managed to find time.</p>
                <p>"She looked at me, but did not recognize the strange lady in front of her. She
                    only recognized her own clothes. Then she uttered a cry of delight and embraced
                    me violently.</p>

                <p>time,' she declared, and applauded my appearance. She peeped at me from every
                    angle. I had to turn about and assume every possible position. Finally she
                    asserted that I was very much prettier as a girl than as a man. I wore ladies'
                    clothes very much better than male costume. 'Yes,' she maintainedâ€”and I have
                    never forgotten these words, 'you know, <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>, you were certainly a girl in a former existence, or
                    else Nature has made a mistake with you this time.'</p>
                <p>"She spoke quite slowly, quite deliberately, and it was obvious that she was
                    strangely stirred.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> gave me a hint to take off the
                    clothes, as <persName>Anna Larsen</persName> could now pose herself.</p>
                <p>"I made a movement to retire; but <persName>Anna Larsen</persName> held me back.
                    'No,' she cried, 'I simply could not endure to meet <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> again to-day. We won't even speak of him. Listen, and
                    now I will christen you, my girlie. You shall receive a particularly lovely,
                    musical name. For example, <persName><hi rend="italic">Lili</hi></persName>.
                    What do you say to <hi rend="italic">Lili</hi>? Henceforth I will call you
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. And we must celebrate this! What
                    do you say, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>?'</p>
                <p>"And <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> merely nodded, looked now at
                        <persName>Anna</persName>, now at the child about to be christened; and then
                    the three of us kept up rejoicings until far into the nightâ€”<persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>'s christening night.</p>
                <p>"So <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> came into existence, and the name
                    stuck; nor was it merely a question of the name.</p>
                <p>"With an extravagant joke, a genuine accident of the studio, if you like, it
                    started, and for many years we played our game with <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>.</p>
                <p>"A few weeks after <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>'s christening an
                    artists' ball was held. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> suggested
                    that <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> should go</p>

                <p>in order to be introduced into the larger world, and she designed a pierrette's
                    costume.</p>
                <p>"It was a complete success. <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> was one of
                    the most popular dancers of the evening. An officer paid her special attentions.
                    Eventually he called her out for every dance, and towards midnight he became
                    somewhat obtrusive. Then <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> tried to
                    disclose her secret. It availed her nothingâ€”the officer simply would not believe
                    her! When she managed to escape, she fell out of the frying- pan into the fire.
                    A fresh cavalier caught hold of her, and would not let her go. On the spot he
                    requested permission to kiss her, at least, on the neck. When at length she
                    escaped from his clutches, the pierrette costume bore some trace of the
                    struggle.</p>
                <p>"Another remarkable fact came to <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>'s
                    notice during this ballâ€”the attitude of the female sex towards her. Several
                    times she had regarded with a friendly smile such ladies as she found
                    attractive. But most of them had returned her confident look with an icy stare.
                    She was perplexed, and at last inquired of <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> whether she had behaved herself badly, whether she looked
                    impossible. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> said with a smile, 'Our
                    stupid <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> is very young. She does not yet
                    know the malice and mistrust of women towards other women.'</p>
                <p>"It was the first time that <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> was
                    conscious of possessing a separate personality. And out of this amusing incident
                    came something like a presentiment. How often have my thoughts wandered back to
                    that far-off evening!</p>
                <p>"But this evening yielded another experience, which was no less
                    characteristic.</p>

                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> were preparing to return home. In the search for her cloak
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> ran into the arms of a tall painter
                    who belonged to the academy <!-- should this be a placeName? -->. He was one of
                    my four studio comrades. For heaven's sake, what could I do to prevent the
                    secret from being discovered? <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> behaved
                    as if she had not seen him. He seized her, squeezed her, and pressed half a
                    dozen kisses on her neck. This time <hi rend="italic">I</hi> came to <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>'s assistance. A few well-armed blows caught
                    the insolent fellow right on the face . . . . <persName>Hauwitz</persName> was
                    the man's name.</p>
                <p>"When I entered the class in the academy the following day, I found the comrades
                    in the thick of a discussion of the carnival night. <persName>Hauwitz</persName>
                    was the most enthusiastic of them all. He recounted his experiences in the grand
                    manner.</p>
                <p>"'But where were you hiding yesterday?' he attacked me at once. The others, too,
                    asked me why I had not been present, especially as <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> had been there.</p>
                <p>"I explained that I had not felt well. Anyhow, I knew that the comrades enjoyed
                    themselves very much, especially <persName>Hauwitz</persName>, who had courted a
                    pierrette very ardently.</p>
                <p>"How did I know that, threw in <persName>Hauwitz</persName>, flattered: a man
                    could not move, it seemed, without giving rise to gossip; who, then, has been so
                    indiscreet as to betray his little adventure?</p>
                <p>"'I know you're a famous heart-breaker,' said I. 'Let's hear all about it.'</p>
                <p>"At first <persName>Hauwitz</persName> refused chivalrously. 'I hope I'm a
                    gentleman. Moreover, the pierrette was really a fabulous person.'</p>
                <p>"He simpered and winked at me expectantly.</p>

                <p>The others crowded round him. 'Fire away, <persName>Hauwitz</persName>,' they
                    encouraged him.</p>
                <p>"'No; friend <persName key="sparreAn">Sparre</persName> seems to know all about
                    it. Ask him,' he replied meaningly.</p>
                <p>"'But, my dear <persName>Hauwitz</persName>, please do not misunderstand me. I
                    should be the last to give anyone away,' I retorted, inquiring at the same time:
                    'Was she really so pretty, then?'</p>
                <p>"'You can suppose as much as you like,' broke out <persName>Hauwitz</persName>.
                    'You cannot go too far in your suppositions. An unheard of thing!'</p>
                <p>"Whereupon he relapsed into silence, which was more eloquent than the coarsest
                    boasting.</p>
                <p>"To my intimate friends I afterwards confessed who the pierrette was.
                        <persName>Hauwitz</persName> was only initiated into the secret much later,
                    after he had found further opportunity to pose as

                        >Lili</persName> became accustomed to her rÃ´le with growing success.
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> titivated her each time, so that

                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> gradually became indispensable to

                    person. And when <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> was thereâ€”that is,
                    when I was not thereâ€”I was spoken of between her and <persName key="sparreGre"

                <p>friends learned all this. But it was still a game for many years.</p>
                <p>"In the depths of her soul <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> is utterly
                    melancholy. And to banish such feeling she summoned her playmate <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>,
                    was, in fact, carelessness and serenity personified. Gradually <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName> became equally important to her mistress in
                    the capacity of a model; indeedâ€”I can say it calmly nowâ€”<persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> has been <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s
                    favourite model. Whether it was chance or not, <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> had more and more success with pictures for which
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> posed as model. And she began to
                    see in <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> a kind of mascot, a talisman
                    that brought luck. A large number of <persName key="sparreGre"
                    >Grete</persName>'s pictures and drawings originated at that time in our first
                    studio in <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName>, in which <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> appears as model in a hundred different poses. <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s artistic fame spread. But nobody knew who
                    was concealed behind the model. Legends sprang up around it. Rumour also began
                    to whisper, without, however, discovering the track of the secret.</p>
                <p>"A well-known writer asserted that the model <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> was no creature of flesh and blood at all, but merely a
                    female type, upon which <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s imagination
                    had fastened, and therefore an empty caprice.</p>
                <p>"Only a few suspected the connection. But nobody knew anything definite about the
                    mystery of <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>â€”with the exception of
                        <persName>Anna Larsen</persName>, who, however, had been sworn to silence.
                    She kept her word.</p>
                <p>"One day <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> received an invitation from
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName> to exhibit her '<persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> sketches'.</p>
                <p>"And so the three of us were transplanted to <placeName>Paris</placeName>:
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, I, andâ€”<persName key="courtaud"

                <p>"Before our removal to <placeName>Paris</placeName> we had already made several
                    journeys abroad.</p>
                <p>Whenever we were able to spare sufficient money from the sale of our picturesâ€”we
                    were extremely frugal in our mode of livingâ€”we had travelled South, to study, to
                    paint, and to become acquainted with the world. <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> had not been with us upon any of these trips. There were
                    too many new things to see for <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and I
                    to find any time to devote to her. But as soon as we found ourselves again in
                    our native studio, she reappearedâ€”and then we had to acknowledge every time that
                    we had really missed her.</p>
                <p>"We spent almost a whole year in <placeName>Italy</placeName> without <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. It was the most carefree year which I ever
                    passed with <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. The romance of the South
                    was an indescribably splendid revelation to us two children of the North.</p>
                <p>"How could we find time to . . . play? <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                    was at that time serenity itself. In <placeName>Italy</placeName>'s wonderland
                    she never felt oppressed. She needed no distraction. Hence <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName> was not conjured up by her.</p>
                <p>"And yet <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> was probably more than ever
                    closely bound up with us both. Only it was no longer a pastime. About that time
                    I began to undergo a change in myself, the nature of which I did</p>

                <p>not then realize. I first became aware of it through my influence upon <hi
                        rend="italic">others</hi> . . . in <placeName>Italy</placeName> just at that
                    time. In <placeName>Florence</placeName> an unfortunate person approached me. He
                    was a wealthy foreigner. One day, after he had been dogging me for weeks, he
                    spoke to me and suggested that I should take up my quarters in his villa, where
                    I could pursue my studies as a painter to my heart's content. I declined
                    politely, but very firmly. After that I saw him frequently. I was always with a
                    lady, either with <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> or in the company
                    of a strikingly beautiful Sicilian. A very little more and I should have been
                    obliged to challenge this poor creature to a duel with pistols.</p>
                <p>"In <placeName>Rome</placeName> I had a similar adventure. In that city an
                    American millionaire wanted me to accompany him to <placeName>Egypt</placeName>.
                    He pestered not only me, but also <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. He
                    sailed alone to <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>.</p>
                <p>"Never before had I been placed in such delicate situations. Why this happened
                    just then in <placeName>Italy</placeName> I only realized much later. When
                        <persName>Professor Kreutz</persName> recently saw in
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName> a number of photographs taken of me during
                    recent years, including some taken on my first Italian trip, he pointed to these
                    very pictures with the words: 'That was when <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> could be distinctly recognized in appearance for the first
                    time.'</p>
                <p>"In due course we returned to <placeName>Paris</placeName>.</p>
                <p>"In the neighbourhood of the <placeName>Ecole des Beaux Arts</placeName>, on the
                    left bank of the <placeName>Seine</placeName>, we stayed in one of the numerous
                    small hotels. The landlord and his wife were not attractive, but their charming
                    little daughter was like a ravishing kitten. Their like is only to be found in
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName>.</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>"Two pleasant rooms, painted bright red and greyish colours, were assigned to us.
                    One of them overlooked an old neglected garden, and had a mysterious alcove,
                    with red-diapered curtains. The factotum of the hotel, Jean by name, lost no
                    time in telling us that <persName>Oscar Wilde</persName> had spent his last days
                    in these two rooms. He had died in the alcove with the red-diapered curtains. As
                    Jean was telling us this, the tears ran down his ill-shorn cheeks. He had reason
                    to regret <persName>Oscar Wilde</persName>'s death. Many a twenty-franc piece
                    had been given him by the unfortunate poet, with which to buy a few sous' worth
                    of cigarettes, and he had never been asked for the change, he added, as a
                    delicate hint to us.</p>
                <p>"For <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and I these two quiet rooms were
                    altogether delightful. We often sat in front of the broad window overlooking the
                    garden and read page after page of the works of the poet, whom I had admired for
                    many years. Gradually <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and I came to
                    know "De Profundis" and "The Ballad of Reading Gaol" by heart. They were lovely
                    evenings.</p>
                <p>"Quite close to the hotel we found our favourite cafÃ©, '<placeName>Chateau neuf
                        du Pape</placeName>', where art students mainly foregathered. A very modest
                    little restaurant; but one could dine sumptuously there for one franc thirty.
                    The wine was included in the price. Here we met our first Parisian friends.</p>
                <p>"Shortly afterwards <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was invited by the
                    editor to contribute to a well-known Parisian illustrated periodical. He had, in
                    fact, seen <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s pictures and sketches at
                    her first exhibition in <placeName>Paris</placeName>.</p>

                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was all on fire to begin her
                    contributions immediately. But what should she offer? How quickly could she hunt
                    up a suitable model?</p>
                <p>"She looked at me inquiringly, hesitated a few moments, and then said: 'What do
                    you think if <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> . . .'</p>
                <p>"I confess that I was at first somewhat surprised. I too had forgotten <persName

                        <placeName>Paris</placeName>, just as I had during our first Italian trip.

                    <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had hitherto not required the company
                    of <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> either for the purposes of her work
                    or by way of distraction.</p>
                <p>"'Very good,' I said; 'but what shall she put on?'</p>
                <p>"<persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>'s 'outfit' had been left behind in
                        <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName>. Quite apart from the fact that <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName> was considerably bigger than the very dainty
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, the strictest separation of
                    property was observed by us with regard to the wardrobe.</p>
                <p>"The most necessary things for <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> were
                    quickly procured. She was not a little proud of her first real Parisian
                    costume.</p>
                <p>"Thus she came to life again in the heart of <placeName>Paris</placeName>. The
                    sketches for which she sat as model were successful. <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> was radiant. She obtained considerable prices for her work
                    and we were able to rent a pleasant studio for ourselves. We settled in
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName>, and built up our circle of friends and
                    acquaintances.</p>

                    a model. We earned good money, and <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                    could hire 'strange models'.</p>
                <p>"When we had put aside sufficient money for an educational tour, we set out again
                    for <placeName>Italy</placeName>. Our objective was
                    <placeName>Capri</placeName>. For years we had been longing to become acquainted
                    with this paradise of sunshine.</p>
                <p>"Scarcely had we arrived there than to our great delight we ran up against a
                    painter from <placeName>Florence</placeName>whose acquaintance we had made
                    during our first Italian journey. <persName>Nino</persName> we called him.
                    Henceforth we were inseparable. Within a few days we had more acquaintances
                    among the cosmopolitan artists with whom <placeName>Capri</placeName> was
                    teeming than was always agreeable. Three or four times a day we met at the
                        '<placeName>Morgano</placeName>', and evening after evening we played chess
                    and draughts. It went without saying that we mustered our full strength during
                    bathing-hours on the tiny beach at <placeName>Piccola Marina</placeName>.</p>
                <p>"Here we met one day a Scotsman, who always appeared in the company of a very
                    pretty boy. When bathing the boy was transformed, to our astonishment, into a
                    very nice girl.</p>
                <p>"'Just what I expected,' declared a Venetian sculptor who belonged to our clique
                    when this revelation burst upon us. 'I knew it from the start! A girl cannot
                    impersonate a man, neither can a man impersonate a girl. Those who have eyes to
                    see can detect the deception immediately. Some superficial thing always gives
                    the game away.' The man's name was <persName key="flavio">Favio</persName>.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> threw me a saucy look. I

                <p>what it meant. At the hour of promenade the next afternoon <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> appeared in the company of a tall, slender
                    young lady whom no one had hitherto seen in <placeName>Capri</placeName>. They
                    strolled past the '<placeName>Morgano</placeName>', where <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had to return many curious greetings from

                    after me, and expressed the hope that I was not ill, as no one had seen me that
                    day. Would <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and I like to come to a

                <p>"The signora had achieved her aim, and she hastened to invite Mademoiselle

                        >Madame Sparre</persName> to the social evening. We accepted with
                    pleasure.</p>
                <p>"The mystification succeeded beyond all expectation. <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>'s French friend was welcomed with extreme cordiality by
                    the whole company. A well-known Norwegian lady novelist pledged Mademoiselle
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> in a lively toast as 'the most
                    perfect incarnation of French charm and Parisian elegance'. She did not stir
                    from <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>'s side. She invited <persName

                        >Grete</persName> were both delighted, for the enchanting, perhaps I should
                    say the piquant, thing about this new friendship was that this passionate
                    Norwegian had hitherto shown a striking aversion to me.</p>

                <p>"In the following days <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s French friend
                    gave a few more performances. In order to explain my continued absence,
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> told everybody who was curious on
                    the point that her friend <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> and I did not
                    get on at all well together. But <placeName>Capri</placeName> is a small place,
                    and <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> was soon obliged to 'depart', in
                    order to leave the field clear for me. <persName key="flavio">Favio</persName>
                    and all the others remained completely unsuspecting.</p>
                <p>"When we returned to <placeName>Paris</placeName>, it frequently happened that
                    after <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had employed her as a model
                    during the hours of daylight, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> remained
                    in bed during the whole evening. And if one or other of our intimate friends
                    dropped in, she did not, as formerly, fly into another room, but stayed where
                    she was and where the others were, and behaved charmingly.</p>
                <p>"Gradually everybody came to like her. She was, as <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> was always obliged to acknowledge, the good fairy of all
                    our little studio festivities.</p>
                <p>"But everybody made a great distinction between <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> and me. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s female
                    friends, who treated me with almost ceremonial propriety, embraced <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName> and petted her. So did <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s and my male friends.</p>
                <p>"It was also strange that when <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> found
                    herself among <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s lady friendsâ€”who,
                    like herself, were artists almost without exceptionâ€” she felt the most feminine
                    of them all. At first the friends laughed somewhat heartily at this fact, but
                    gradually observed that <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>'s feeling was
                    genuine.</p>
                <p>"And thus it came to pass that month after month <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> insisted with growing stubbornness on her rights, and gave
                    place to me with increasing reluctance.</p>
                <p>"In the <placeName>Salon d'Automne</placeName>, where we both</p>

                    sculptor, <persName>Jean TempÃªte</persName>. This acquaintance was to lead to
                    new experiences for <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>.</p>
                <p>"He possessed a summer-house in a small town on the <placeName>Loire</placeName>.
                    Assisted by a number of friends, he intended giving a theatrical performance
                    upon the tiny stage of this small town for charitable purposes.
                        <placeName>Balgencie</placeName> was the name of the place.</p>
                <p>"He invited <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and I to take part.</p>
                <p>"It proved to be a delightful drive. The small town was a miniature
                        <placeName>Rothenburg</placeName>.</p>
                <p>"The 'theatre', which was to be occupied by us that same evening, looked from the
                    outside like a tobacco shop with a cafÃ© attached. The interior was usually let
                    for cinematograph exhibitions and dances. As there was only one piece of
                    scenery, which, moreover, was useless for our purpose, <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> was immediately appointed scene-painter. With lightning
                    rapidity she sketched the stage scenery for the revue, which had been composed
                    by <persName>Jean TempÃªte</persName> himself.</p>
                <p>"At six o'clock in the evening everything was ready, and at nine o'clock the
                    performance was to begin.</p>
                <p>"At seven o'clock <persName>TempÃªte</persName> and I repaired to the station, in
                    order to fetch the only member of our company who was still missing, a young
                    lady artist who for some reason or other had not been able to travel with the
                    others. She had to play a minor part, that of a typical Parisienne.</p>
                <p>"The train arrived, but our Parisienne was not on board. It was the last train
                    before the performance.</p>

                <p>"<persName>TempÃªte</persName> raved. Small as the part was, without the player
                    the piece would collapse.</p>
                <p>"'Then we must ask <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> to step into the
                    breach,' I declared.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and I, who had only been invited to
                    join the travelling party at the eleventh hour, did not belong to the company of
                    players.</p>
                <p>"'An excellent idea!' exclaimed <persName>TempÃªte</persName>, and the moment he
                    entered the so-called hotel where we had found accommodation, he pounced upon
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. Completely exhausted by her
                    scene-painting, she was lying on a rickety sofa.</p>
                <p>"'Out of the question,' she declared. 'With the best will in the world, I cannot
                    do it.' Then she gave me a furtive look. 'But perhaps . . . <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName> can?'</p>
                <p>"'Who is <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>?' asked
                        <persName>TempÃªte</persName>. They all asked the same question.</p>
                <p>"'Don't worry about that. The main thing is that she comes. She can play the part
                    without any trouble,' <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> assured the
                    curious circle. She caught hold of <persName>TempÃªte</persName>, drew him aside,
                    and gave him the necessary explanations. He shook with laughter, promised to
                    hold his tongue, and then it was arranged that while <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> was being dressed he should initiate her into the part of
                    the fast-dyed Parisienne in the seclusion of an hotel sitting-room.</p>
                <p>"When evening came and the revue was launched in front of a crowded audience, not
                    a soul in the hall suspected that <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> was
                    not a genuine Parisienne. Moreover, the poetically minded chemist of
                        <placeName>Balgencie</placeName>, who was a member of the charity committee,
                    was so enthusiastic over</p>

                <p><persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> that he sent a box of violet soap to the
                    unknown beauty at her hotel.</p>
                <p>"On this evening <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> became acquainted with
                    her truest friend, <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude Lejeune</persName>, the
                    tenor of the revue. He was the comic character of the evening. His mere
                    appearance on the stage unloosed a storm of merriment. He was the only real
                    artiste in this company of amateurs; that is to say, he was the only member of
                    it who was not an amateur.</p>
                <p>"Earlier in the day I had already noticed this young artiste, who with his droll,
                    lightning wit might have bobbed up in any <placeName>Montmartre</placeName> bar.
                    He had completely irregular features and colourless, somewhat deep-set eyes, the
                    whole capped by a funny, pointed nose. At first glance he would probably appear
                    ugly, but if one looked at him somewhat longer one would become conscious of a
                    remarkable geniality and kindliness which his whole personality radiated.</p>
                <p>"If anything he had given me ( <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>) the
                    cold shoulder, but his conduct towards <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>
                    was of quite another character.</p>
                <p>"It went without saying that, like the rest of his colleagues from
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName>, he was soon 'in the picture'. As for the rest,
                    discretion was observed.</p>
                <p>"And the citizens, who had arranged a charity ball after the performance was
                    over, of which we 'Parisians' were to form the centre of attraction, saw in
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, who at the desire of all the
                    company had remained in her stage costume, the typical Parisienne. Wherever she
                    showed herself, she was treated with exquisite courtesy. She enjoyed herself
                    immensely. She was sought after more than</p>

                <p>any other dancer at the ball. When at length she found she could skip a dance,
                        <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude Lejeune</persName> made his way towards
                    her, bowed in his most amusing way, then, in order to show the most serious face
                    in the world, screwed his monocle tighter into his eye, even blushed a little,
                    and said almost solemnly: 'Mademoiselle, may I, as soon as you have somewhat
                    recovered, solicit the honour of being your dancing partner a number of times in
                    succession?' <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> looked at him somewhat
                    surprised, and then nodded. And during this night they danced together many
                    times. They were both about the same height. During the dancing they scarcely
                    spoke a word to each other. They danced, completely surrendering themselves to
                    the rhythm of the dance.</p>
                <p>"When the last dance was over, <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude
                        Lejeune</persName> bowed very low before <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>, blushed again, and said: 'Mademoiselle, may I hope you
                    will honour the excursion we are making to-morrow with your presence?'</p>
                <p>"The other comrades also begged <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, and she
                    promised with a smile. Only the 'Parisians' took part in this excursion,
                    otherwise <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> could hardly have been
                    present. The day passed in perfect harmony, and it was arranged that everybody
                    should meet again in <placeName>Balgencie</placeName> on the first of August, to
                    spend their holidays together on the banks of the <placeName>Loire</placeName>.
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> was specially invited. She
                    promised, on behalf of her brother <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>.

                    in the evening the little town was shrouded in darkness, whether the moon was

                    impetuous, and treacherous winds render a sail rather dangerous. It was
                    therefore necessary for <persName key="cupid">Cupid</persName>, as well as his
                    attendant, to be strong swimmers. As no practised and daring swimmer could be
                    discovered among the young ladies of the town, <persName>Jean TempÃªte</persName>
                    very discreetly asked me if I could not assume <persName key="cupid"
                        >Cupid</persName>'s rÃ´1e, provided <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude
                        Lejeune</persName> was assigned to me as squire. I was known to be an
                    excellent swimmer. I promised on behalf of <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> and also of <persName>Claude</persName>, who had meanwhile
                    become a good friend of ours.</p>
                <p>"Thus on the banks of this ancient township, into which <persName>Joan of
                        Arc</persName> had made her entry as a warrior in steel and iron centuries
                    before, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> was dressed up as the boy
                        <persName key="cupid">Cupid</persName>. . . . The carnival took place in
                    glorious midsummer weather. The whole population stood on the shore and greeted
                        <persName key="cupid">Cupid</persName> with frantic cheers as he sailed in
                    triumph upon the smooth glassy surface of the <placeName>Loire</placeName>. With
                    his golden bow he shot a rain of arrows at the thousands of heads peeping
                    through the trellis-work on the shore. And everybody believed that behind
                        <persName key="cupid">Cupid</persName>'s mask was concealed the typical
                    Parisienne from the revue of the last charity performance.</p>
                <p>"Upon <persName>Claude</persName> had devolved the task, after the carnival was
                    over, of conducting <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> to her hotel
                    through a crowd wild with enthusiasm,</p>

                <p><num style="page">83</num></p>
                <p>and when at length he brought her intact to her room, he looked at her long and
                    then said, very quietly: 'However you dress up and whatever you want to make me
                    believe, you are a genuine girl.'</p>
                <p>"He stopped, startled at his own temerity. <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> stared at him.</p>
                <p>"'What is the matter, <persName>Claude</persName>?' she asked.</p>
                <p>"'Nothing,' he said quietly, 'nothing at all. Or it is something? But if I told
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> what I was just thinking and what I
                    have been thinking all day, her brother <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> would certainly be very angry with me.'</p>
                <p>"Then he went, and when we saw each other again the following morning he looked
                    at me shyly and kept out of my way. <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> had
                    again disappeared.</p>
                <p>"Year after year we all met again at <placeName>Balgencie</placeName>, where I
                    gradually became accustomed to <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>'s and my
                    double experience. <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> took part in the
                    festivities and excursions. I painted very industriously, swam and drank many
                    glasses of wine with the notabilities of the town. I had many friends there. All
                    the inhabitants of the town knew me and were delighted to recognize their houses
                    and gardens and themselves in pictures of mine, which might subsequently hang in
                    the autumn exhibitions of <placeName>Paris</placeName>. But nobody in the town
                    suspected the identity of the slender Parisienne who now and then strolled with
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName>Claude</persName>
                    through the alleys of the town and out into the country. These trips were among
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>'s most delightful recollections. In
                    the early dawn, before any bedroom window was opened, the three of them</p>
                <pb n="97"/>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">84</num></p>
                <p>would march out into the summer morning, and not until late in the evening, when
                    the town had long since retired to rest, did they return, tired and happy.
                        <persName>Claude</persName> was then <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>'s and <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>'s most
                    delightful cavalier; he was their brother and protector, and the friendship
                    between them became ever more intimate and permanent, a friendship which stood
                    every test.</p>
                <p>"It went without saying that this 'triple alliance' continued in
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName>. Every Sunday <persName>Claude</persName> made
                    his appearance, when he was the guest of the studio for the whole of the day.
                    And in accordance with an unwritten law, <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> always received him at the door in the corridor. If,
                    however, she was, by a rare chance, absent, and I had to open the door to him,
                    we greeted each other in a very comradely way; he gave me his hand, asked about
                    this and that; but I could always remark his disappointment. In the studio he
                    would then look at my pictures, although quite cursorily; politics and similar
                    topics were touched on in conversation and even the latest Parisian scandal. But
                    it did not last long, at the most a quarter of an hour, and then
                        <persName>Claude</persName> would look at me somewhat uncertainly. 'I have
                    not yet said good day to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>.' And then
                    he would disappear into the little kitchen to join <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>.</p>
                <p>"But if <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> opened the door to him on
                    Sundays, he would at once go with her into the kitchen.</p>
                <p>"In this connection I recall a little incident which happened just at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>"<persName>Claude</persName> had come to see us one weekday evening. <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was not at home. I then suggested to him
                    that we should visit some amusing dancing-bar</p>
                <pb n="98"/>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">85</num></p>
                <p>in the <placeName>Quartier Latin</placeName> together. We landed in the Gipsy
                    Bar, where <persName>Claude</persName> ordered the speciality of the house,
                    namely a coffin-nail. This cocktail was not unworthy of its very promising name.
                    A frequent repetition of the enjoyment of this drink during a day or a night is
                    calculated to curtail considerably our sojourn here below. Perhaps it was this
                    drink which prompted us to try out a new dance which <persName>Claude</persName>
                    had recently seen somewhere. Moreover, it was the first time that he had danced
                    with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. We had scarcely taken the first step before the
                    manager made a dash at us and requested us to stop dancing immediately. The
                    gentlemen must excuse him; he knew us both very well, but in his establishment,
                    unfortunately, they did not allow two gentlemen to dance together.</p>
                <p>"We duly explained to the strict gentleman that all we were concerned about was
                    trying out a new dance. He answered: 'Messieurs, I am sorry, but gentlemen are
                    not allowed to dance together here. If I permitted it only for one occasion, and
                    I know that in your case I am dealing with irreproachable gentlemen, my
                    establishment would be over-run by persons of a certain type and its reputation
                    would suffer injury.'</p>
                <p>We sat down again with a laugh, ordered a harmless aperitif, and then went
                    home.</p>
                <p>The next evening <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, and <persName>Claude</persName> visited the
                    dancing-bar. <persName>Claude</persName> had, in the meantime, taught both
                    ladies the same dance, and shortly after entering the bar
                        <persName>Claude</persName> and <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>
                    executed the extremely complicated dance without a hitch, amid the vigorous
                    applause of the manager.</p>

                <p><num style="page">86</num></p>
                <p>"Then he came over to <persName>Claude</persName>'s table, made a polite bow to
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, and especially to <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, and said: 'I hope that your friend, whom I
                    am sorry not to see with you to-day, has not avoided my establishment because he
                    was irritated at the little incident of yesterday evening.
                        <persName>Monsieur</persName> will understand."</p>
                <p>"'Oh, we understand,' answered <persName>Claude</persName>, 'and I can assure you
                    that my friend is not annoyed in the least.'</p>
                <p>"And the manager turned to <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>: 'May I offer
                    Mademoiselle my heartiest congratulations? Mademoiselle dances charmingly,
                    charmingly." And then, turning to <persName>Claude</persName>:
                        '<persName>Monsieur</persName> will admit that his partner of yesterday
                    cannot be compared in the least with Mademoiselle.'</p>
                <p>"In connection with this amusing encounter I must tell you about another
                    experience, which also happened about this time.</p>
                <p>"Together with <persName>Claude</persName> and <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> was sometimes
                    invited to a smart artists' club. The club evening usually consisted of a meal
                    followed by a ball. One evening, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                    being tired, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> went there alone with
                        <persName>Claude</persName>, at his urgent request. A lady who was an
                    intimate friend of ours and knew me as well as <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>â€”for the rest, nobody in the club suspected our double
                    existenceâ€”made a point this evening of introducing <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> to a number of gentlemen, including her cousin, a nobleman
                    who was no longer quite young. Hitherto <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>
                    had declined to make fresh acquaintances on these club evenings, which were rare
                    events for her. She was happy enough dancing with <persName>Claude</persName>,
                    and did not need any other partners. Yet, before she could decline, her friend
                    fetched her cousin: 'My cousin, le</p>
                <pb n="100"/>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">87</num></p>
                <p><persName>Comte de Trempe</persName>â€”la <persName key="courtaud">Baronne Lili de
                        Cortaud</persName>.' The gallant Count immediately challenged <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName> to a fox-trot. This dance was followed by
                    several more. <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> could not refuse.
                        <persName>Claude</persName> nodded to her merrily. Thus it happened that
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> danced with her new cavalier until
                    far into the night. When at length, completely exhausted, she said farewell to
                    him 'for the present', with the most solemn face in the world he begged
                        '<persName>Madame la Baronne</persName>', who, as his cousin had whispered,
                    was staying with <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> for a few days, to
                    allow him to pay his respects to her the following day. What else could
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> do than make the best of a bad
                    job?</p>
                <p>"When <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> reached home, <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was fast asleep.</p>
                <p>"The next morning, while <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> was telling
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> about her conquest in the club,
                    the bell rang in the corridor. The <persName>Count</persName> appeared; he made
                    profuse apologiesâ€”<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had opened the
                    doorâ€”in case he was intruding, but he only wanted to inquire after the health of
                    her guest, the <persName key="courtaud">Baroness Lili de Cortaud</persName>.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> regretted sincerely that her visitor
                    had already gone out, and showed the <persName>Count</persName> into the studio,
                    where he immediately discovered portraits of <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> all over the place. He was beside himself with enthusiasm.
                    Might he wait until the <persName>Baroness</persName> returned? <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> assured him that this would be a useless
                    undertaking, as her visitor, who was also her sister-in-law, had been invited to
                    dinner with friends.</p>
                <p>"'Oh,' the <persName>Count</persName> then exclaimed, 'so your husbandâ€”<persName
                        key="sparreAn">Monsieur Sparre</persName>â€”is brother to the

                <p>"'When may I perhaps have the pleasure of calling on <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Monsieur Sparre</persName>?' asked the <persName>Count</persName>, almost
                    flurried.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> promised to let him know soon through
                    his cousin.</p>
                <p>"The following dayâ€”we were taking tea in our studio with a few friends and were
                    just discussing <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>'s involuntary
                    experienceâ€”the corridor bell rang again. The <persName>Count</persName>!</p>
                <p>"'I am sincerely delighted,' he began at once in his ceremonious way, 'to pay you
                    a visit' (I could scarcely find time to usher him in). 'As I have already told
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Madame Sparre</persName>, the day before yesterday
                    I made the acquaintance of your sister, the charming
                        <persName>Baroness</persName>, and I am most anxious to see her again.'</p>
                <p>"Of course it was now very difficult to keep up the pose, but we succeeded in
                    doing so, and I replied: 'My sister will certainly be sorry to have missed the
                    pleasure of shaking hands with you again, monsieur.'</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and our visitors had great difficulty
                    in strangling an outburst of Homeric laughter. I had to throw them a warning
                    look. Without thinking, I continued: 'Unfortunately, we are seeing very little
                    of our sister these days, invited everywhere . . . very much sought after . . .
                    scarcely home before midnight.'</p>
                <p>"'Yes, I quite understand that,' said the <persName>Count</persName>, looking at
                    me searchingly. My heart felt like an anvil trembling under the strokes of a

                <p>his monocle at every word: 'It is very strange that you are brother and sister,
                    for <persName key="courtaud">Madame de Cortaud</persName> does not resemble you
                    in the least, my dear sir.'</p>
                <p>"I agreed emphatically, and gave <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> an
                    imploring look to keep a straight face. I had just finished a lengthy and prolix
                    assurance that my sister and I did not resemble each other in the least, when
                    the <persName>Count</persName> addressed to me an inquiry as to whether my
                    sister was, as his cousin intimated to him, not engaged, was really free.</p>
                <p>"Foolishly enough I did not contest this point.</p>
                <p>"Whereupon he made an exemplary bow and, without beating about the bush,
                    declared: 'Then, monsieur, I have the honour of offering the
                        <persName>Baroness</persName> my hand.'</p>
                <p>"I thanked him in the name of my sister and promised to inform her of his
                    flattering offer. He then withdrew, amidst the exchange of numerous
                    compliments.</p>
                <p>"A moment later our studio was rocking with the roaring laughter of <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and our visitors.</p>
                <p>"I did not join in. <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>'s experience at the
                    ball was taking her out of her depth. I had to think of a way out.</p>
                <p>"'Quite simple,' cried <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, whose laughter
                    had brought tears into her eyes. 'I will tell the cousin to inform the
                        <persName>Count</persName> that his lady-love has been suddenly obliged to
                    leave for <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName> for very urgent family reasons. For
                    the present a return to <placeName>Paris</placeName> is out of the
                    question.'</p>
                <p>"And so it happened. A few postcards which we caused to be posted to the
                        <persName>Count</persName> by a friend in <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName>,
                    who had to forge <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>'s 'handwriting',</p>

                <p>gradually convinced him of the 'hopelessness' of his wooing.</p>
                <p>"He never learnt who <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> was.</p>
                <p>"Even stranger was something that happened at the house of my sister and my
                        <persName key="brotherChris">brother-in-law</persName> in
                        <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName>, where we were staying some months later
                    on a visit.</p>
                <p>"My little niece had seen pictures of <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>,
                    and wanted to see this remarkable person for once 'in the life'. So it was
                    arranged that she should be present one Sunday afternoon, which my parents were
                    also to spend with my relatives. My parents had not seen <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and me for a number of years. Consequently
                        <persName key="father">father</persName> and <persName>mother</persName>
                    were disappointed to learn on their arrival that I was not expected until later,
                    as I had a very important call to make first. Suddenly the bell rang in the
                    hall. The girl announced that a French lady was in the passage and wanted to
                    speak to <persName key="sparreGre">Madame Grete Sparre</persName>. The lady was
                    brought in; <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> welcomed her in the most
                    cordial manner. It was a friend from <placeName>Paris</placeName>â€”unfortunately
                    she only spoke French. And . . . <persName key="father">Father</persName>
                    immediately began a conversation in French! <persName>Mother</persName>, who
                    made him translate everything to her, was enormously proud of him!</p>
                <p>"In the course of the conversation <persName>Mother</persName> suddenly warned
                        <persName key="father">Father</persName> that he should not keep so close to
                    the window with the lady from <placeName>Paris</placeName>. It was the middle of
                    winter. 'Don't forget,' she said to <persName key="father">Father</persName>,
                    looking thoughtfully at the lady, 'the lady comes from a much milder climate and
                    is so thinly clad. Please tell her to sit near the stove.' Then tea was served.
                    And <persName key="father">Father</persName> and <persName>Mother</persName>

                <p>"'No, no!' repeated <persName>Mother</persName>, after a long interval. 'That

                <p>"So <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> and I continued to live our double
                    life, and no one, neither the 'initiated' nor myself, saw in this anything else
                    than a pleasant kind of distraction and entertainment, a kind of artists'
                    caprice, neither more nor less. We were as little perturbed at the obviously
                    growing distinction, of an emotional kind, which increasingly manifested itself
                    between the mystical girl and myself; nor did anyone take any serious notice of
                    the delicate changes which gradually became perceptible in my physical form.</p>
                <p>"But something had been silently preparing in <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.</p>
                <p>"One evening I said suddenly to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>:</p>
                <p>"'Really I cannot imagine what existence would be like if <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName> should one day vanish for ever, or if she
                    should no longer look young and beautiful. Then she would no longer have any
                    justification for living at all.'</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> at first looked at me astonished.
                    Then she nodded and said in her calm, thoughtful way: 'It is strange that you
                    have mentioned something which has been on my mind a good deal lately. In recent
                    months I have felt prickings of conscience because I was, to a certain extent,
                    the cause of creating <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, of enticing her
                    out of you, and thus becoming responsible for a disharmony in you which</p>

                <p>reveals itself most distinctly on those days when <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> does not appear.'</p>
                <p>"I was thunderstruck at <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s words. It
                    was as if she had held up a mirror in front of me.</p>
                <p>"'It often happens,' she continued excitedly, 'that when she poses for me as a
                    model a strange feeling comes over me that it is <hi rend="italic">she</hi> whom
                    I am creating and forming rather than the girl whom I am representing on my
                    canvas. Sometimes it seems to me that here is something which is stronger than
                    we are, something which makes us powerless and will thrust us aside, as if,
                    indeed, it wanted to be revenged on us for having played with it.'</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> broke off. Tears stood in her eyes.
                    'We have come to a steep part of the road, and I don't know where we shall find
                    foothold,' she cried. I tried to calm her; but I scarcely succeeded, at least,
                    not at once. I spoke and she listened to me. 'What you say is all so terribly
                    true. And the most dangerous thing of all is that I feel it is <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, just <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>, who forms the bond between us which has lasted all these
                    years. I do not believe I could survive her.'</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> interrupted me to say that she had
                    very often thought exactly the same, as <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>
                    embodied our common youth and joy in life. She sobbed: 'Sometimes I wonder what
                    life would be without her.'</p>
                <p>"We stared at each other, deeply moved by this mutual confession, which had been
                    provoked by many, many weeks of secret brooding.</p>
                <p>"'At any rate, I cannot imagine, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> went
                    on, 'what it would be like for us without <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>.</p>

                <p>We must not lose her. If she should suddenly vanish, it would seem like a
                    murder.'</p>
                <p>"'The more so as I cannot help feeling that she is on the verge of becoming more
                    vigorous than I am,' I said uneasily.</p>
                <p>"Perhaps this conversation had the effect of plunging me into a momentary fit of
                    despondency; but in other respects my health had been excellent during all these
                    years. In spite of the fact that I had never looked very robust, although I was
                    equal to every physical exertion, I had never really been ill. Just recently I
                    had frequently felt indisposed, my chief sensation being one of utter weariness.
                    Also, I had not stood too well the very cold rainy weather which
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName> had latterly experienced year after year. I
                    would cough from late autumn until spring almost without intermission. No doubt
                    that is how I came to have gloomy thoughts. One cannot be young for ever, I
                    would reflect. And then I would think of <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>. She shared her body with me. She was a woman. To remain
                    young meant more for her than for me.</p>
                <p>"My outlook became more and more melancholy. By nature I had always been a gay
                    person, especially as long as I lived in <placeName>Paris</placeName>. But all
                    this was now over. There were days, weeks, and months when I felt utterly
                    impotent. The power to work went out of me. Everybody who had known me for years
                    knew that I had been an industrious person. I could not understand myself.</p>
                <p>"At intervals there would be a return of more lucid periods, whenever I could
                    live in the country far from <placeName>Paris</placeName> and collect fresh
                    subjects, especially in <placeName>Balgencie</placeName>. But they did not last
                    long. I grew</p>
                <pb n="106"/>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">95</num></p>
                <p>more and more tired, more and more languid. I did not know what to do with
                    myself. It was an unbearable condition to be in.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> began to be uneasy. She persuaded me
                    to see a doctor, and to please her I did so. The doctor found nothing specific
                    the matter and prescribed a nerve tonic. It did no good. A new doctor was
                    consulted, with a similar result, and so on.</p>
                <p>"But when <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> appeared, everything went
                    well, and life was fair once more. Every trace of ill-humour vanished.</p>
                <p>"Consequently she now came as often as possible. In the meantime she had built up
                    her own circle of friends and acquaintances, and she had her own memories and
                    habits, which had nothing whatever to do with me. Often she would stay for
                    several days in succession, and then she would sit contented with <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, or even sit quite alone by herself, sewing
                    or embroidering, and smiling to herself, happy in this feminine occupation.
                    Nobody understood this mystery, neither <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> nor <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>. They all
                    regarded this enigmatic being <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, who
                    built up her own world around her, with head-shakings and astonishment. But they
                    let <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> alone, and she was happy.</p>
                <p>"Something that happened just at this time was to inaugurate, more quickly than
                    was anticipated, the last period of this incessant and ruthless inner struggle
                    between Lili and myself. And for a long time it looked as if neither of us would
                    survive this contest.</p>
                <p>"About two years ago my old friend <persName>Iven Persen</persName> of the
                        <placeName>Theatre Royal</placeName>, <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName>,

                <p>a number of performances among us in <placeName>Paris</placeName>. As his wife,
                    the well-known dancer <persName>Ebba Persen</persName>, accompanied him, a
                    ballet had, of course, to be arranged for one of the evenings. The ballet corps
                    was not large, and it was short of one dancer. Thereupon
                        <persName>Iven</persName>, who knew that I was not a bad dancer, asked
                    whether I would care to take part. Without hesitation I replied in the
                    affirmative.</p>
                <p>"At the ballet rehearsals, which lasted a very long time, I probably over-exerted
                    myself. At any rate, I was then attacked for the first time by strange
                    hÃ¦morrhages. I bled mostly at the nose, but in so unusual a way that <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> became anxious, and implored me to abandon
                    my dancer's part; but I was very unwilling to do this, as I did not want to
                    leave my old friend in the lurch. I saw the business through, although these
                    hÃ¦morrhages came on after the first night and after each of the numerous
                    repetitions. And the most amazing thing of all was that every time I was seized
                    with a fit of utterly strange convulsive sobbing. When the attack was over,
                    however, I felt as if liberated, just as if something torpid in me had been
                    dissolved; as if something new, something never before felt, was stirring. My
                    whole being seemed as if transformed, as if a dam had suddenly burst.</p>
                <p>"Never had music made so disturbing, so shattering an impression on me as on that
                    evening An achingly sweet and yet elevating sensation, which gripped all my
                    senses, so the music wrought on me, moving me to tears, and the tears became
                    convulsive sobs.</p>

                <p>people had been rather imperious and condescending. From the first rehearsal I
                    had been tormented by a feeling of failure. I was utterly astonished at myself.
                    I no longer recognized myself. A strong impulse to resign myself, to obey, to
                    submit myself unconditionally to another will, had seized hold of me. This
                    impulse seemed to dominate me. <persName>Iven</persName>, my old friend and boon
                    companion, acted the chief rÃ´le of the evening, apart from
                        <persName>Ebba</persName>. Only a year before the three of us had been very
                    merry together in <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName>. It had never before
                    occurred to me to play second fiddle to him, to recognize him as the leading
                    spirit! But on this evening, from the time of the first rehearsal, I submitted
                    to him slavishly. Not a word of contradiction on my part did he encounter. And
                    not only that, but I blushed like a boy when he requested me to do this or that
                    step differently, to bow somewhat more or less at some figure or the other, and
                    the like. And if he as much as touched me, I felt so confused that I did not
                    know where to look.</p>
                <p>"In all these psychic disturbances which I then experienced, nothing of an erotic
                    nature played the slightest part. In this respect <persName>Iven</persName> and
                    I had thoroughly sound natures. What it therefore meant I could not discover. It
                    simply <hi rend="italic">was</hi> so. And it was not <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
                    who first observed this change to humility, as <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> called it, but <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                    herself. She teased me about it laughingly. But behind her smile was concealed
                    an unbounded astonishment.</p>
                <p>"For the general rehearsal I wore my dancing-costume for the first time,
                    close-fitting tights, a bolero, and a wig of short curls. After the general
                    rehearsal was over, when I was standing in a dirty,</p>
                <pb n="111"/>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>

                <p>ill-lighted corridor of the theatre, which was to take the place of the
                    non-existent dressing-rooms, and while I was in the act of washing off powder
                    and paint, a number of lasquenets, who likewise belonged to the ballet, passed
                    behind me, clinking their weapons. One of them gave me a light slap.</p>
                <p>"'It suits you admirably to play a part in trousers, mademoiselle,' grinned the
                    fellow.</p>
                <p>"When I turned round with an energetic protest, the fellow slipped away,
                    exclaiming: 'There is far too much bluff these days, <hi rend="italic">ma petite
                        demoiselle</hi>?</p>
                <p>"A few minutes later I had to go on the stage. When <persName>Iven</persName>
                    perceived me, he burst out laughing, and cried: 'No, children, this won't do.
                    Now we have too many ladies!'</p>
                <p>"For a moment I did not understand the allusion. Then I turned round perplexed,
                    all eyes upon me and everybody grinning. Red as a turkey-cock I rushed out, ran
                    into the arms of a dresser, clutched him, and begged him 'at the producer's
                    request to dress me rather more like a man'.</p>
                <p>He endeavoured to do so with the assistance of a colleague, and indeed amid the
                    giggles of both worthies. And I pulled myself together and behaved as if all
                    this left me utterly unmoved.</p>
                <p>"The evening before the premiÃ¨re I met in the wings an actor of striking muscular
                    development, who had to dance in the ballet in the same costume as I was
                    wearing. When he saw me, he inspected me from top to toe, and then blurted out
                    angrily: 'Good God, man, you look impossible like that!'</p>
                <p>"I was speechless and felt as if I should like to sink into the earth. Had such a
                    thing previously</p>
                <pb n="112"/>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">99</num></p>
                <p>been said to me by a man, I would have knocked him down.</p>
                <p>"When I afterwards related everything to <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>, she confessed that she too had been struck by the strange
                    alteration in the contours of my body. In my dancing-costume I had looked like a
                    woman impersonating a man.</p>
                <p>"In the time which followed, my nervous condition assumed a feverish character.
                    Henceforth at almost regular intervals these mysterious fits of depression,
                    accompanied by severe hÃ¦morrhages and violent pains, set in. And then, in
                    addition, there were these disconcerting fits of sobbing. At first I thought
                    that I had displaced some internal organ during the ballet performances, and
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> too thought this. Consequently,
                    we went to a doctor, who was really a heart specialist and not competent to deal
                    with my alleged illness. But he had known me for years. Of <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, on the other hand, he knew nothing. Only our
                    most intimate friends had been initiated, among whom the doctor was not
                    numbered. Hence I did not broach the subject of my double life during this
                    visit, although I myself had begun to suspect a connection between this and my
                    physical condition.</p>
                <p>"As, after making a thorough examination, he found nothing which would explain
                    the remarkable phenomena which had recently manifested themselves, he took me to
                    a specialist, whom I had known slightly at <placeName>Versailles</placeName>.
                    This doctor then examined my body with great particularity and growing
                    astonishment, and eventually thought he was able to detect strange
                    irregularities in my inside. For the rest, he declared that the only thing to
                    be</p>
                <pb n="113"/>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">100</num></p>
                <p>done was to wait, especially as my whole constitution was very healthy and
                    unimpaired; such a body as mine could stand a good deal.</p>
                <p>"Although this doctor had not said anything definite, this conversation gave me
                    confidence and an almost mystical hope.</p>
                <p>"By this time I was perfectly clear in my own mind that something of a most
                    unusual character must be happening inside me. I had inferred this more from the
                    doctor's expression than from anything he had said.</p>
                <p>"And then, like so many sick persons who do not know what is really the matter
                    with them, I began to procure all kinds of scientific books dealing with sexual
                    problems. Within a short time I acquired an expert knowledge in this department,
                    and knew many things of which the layman hardly dreams. But gradually it became
                    clear to me that nothing which related to normal men and women could throw any
                    light on my mysterious case.</p>
                <p>"So it came about that I formed an independent opinion, to the effect that I was
                    both man and woman in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> body, and that the woman in
                    this body was in process of gaining the upper hand. Upon this assumption I
                    explained the disturbances, both physical and psychic, from which I was
                    suffering to an increasing extent.</p>
                <p>"All this I confided to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. And when,
                    encouraged by her, I submitted my theory to various doctors in
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName> and <placeName>Versailles</placeName>, they
                    greeted it not merely with head-shakings, but even with disdain. The most polite
                    among them treated me indulgently for every possible illness, while others
                    regarded me as an hysterical subject, or simply as a lunatic.</p>

                <p>"It was a terrible time. My health was on the downgrade, and soon I was unable to
                    get any sleep. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was the only person
                    who believed with me firmly in my theory. I owed it to her that I did not lose
                    faith that one day I should find salvation.</p>
                <p>"Exactly a year ago we journeyed southward once more, to
                        <placeName>Italy</placeName>. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                    thought that a change of air just at this time, when
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName> was having very rainy weather, would do me
                    good. The French winter had been unusually cold. The whole of March had been
                    spoiled by rainy weather. Beyond <placeName>the Alps</placeName> we found the
                    world in blossom.</p>
                <p>"We travelled to <placeName>Rome</placeName>, where we had arranged to meet an
                    Italian officer whom we had met years before in <placeName>Florence</placeName>.
                    He had just returned home on furlough from the East after a long period of
                    colonial service. He was waiting for us at the railway station and escorted us
                    to our hotel, and then we were to dine somewhere in the town. I was utterly
                    exhausted after the long railway journey and was suffering indescribable agony;
                    but I did not want to spoil the day for <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> and our friend. I therefore went with them.</p>
                <p>"We entered <placeName>Facciano</placeName>'s and found a table. Through the open
                    door the soft evening breezes streamed in from the beautiful <placeName>Piazza
                        Colonna</placeName>, where we could see the shimmering white columns in
                    front of the rusty-red faÃ§ade of the <placeName>Palazzo Chigi</placeName>
                    <!-- not marked in the spreadsheet--> and the colonnade of
                        <placeName>Biffi</placeName>
                    <!-- not marked in the spreadsheet -->, which re-echoed to the shrill cries of
                    newspaper sellers, and thus saved one the expense of buying a journal. The
                    orchestra played divinely. I shall never forget that evening.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> sat opposite me.</p>
                <pb n="115"/>

                <p><num style="page">102</num></p>
                <p>"It suddenly flashed upon me that she was looking as if she were hardly
                    twenty-five years old. Every trace of fatigue had been charmed away from her
                    features. And beside her sat our friend <persName key="feruzziRi">Ridolfo
                        Feruzzi</persName>, who was beaming on her. When we had made his
                    acquaintance years ago, it did not seem fated to become an enduring friendship.
                    At that time he had been a half-baked lieutenant. <hi rend="italic">Il bello
                        tenente <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName></hi>, he was then
                    calledâ€”it had been during our first Italian trip. When we parted at that time it
                    had seemed to be for ever, until his letter from the remote colony had reached
                    us in <placeName>Paris</placeName>. Most of its contents had been addressed to
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>.</p>
                <p>"A feeling of deep melancholy stole over me. I found myself thinking of that time
                    and of the years between, and, to some extent, of myself. What had I become?</p>
                <p>"I pulled myself together. A thousand questions were asked, and as many were
                    answered. 'Do you remember the So and Sos? And Mrs. X? Do you remember that
                    evening at Lapi . . . that afternoon in the Casino . . . and the evening which
                    followed in the cinema in the <placeName>Piazza Vittorio Emmanuele</placeName>?'
                    I saw it all as if it had been yesterday, and there was I sitting with <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName key="feruzziRi">Ridolfo
                        Feruzzi</persName> and laughing with them, and sometimes sharing a joke with
                    them. They looked young, just as they did then so many years ago. But I joined
                    in the laughter, although my laugh was forced and mechanical. My old zest in
                    life had vanished. I had become anotherâ€”a despondent person.</p>
                <p>"There in <placeName>Rome</placeName>, a year ago now, I realized</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">103</num></p>
                <p>quite definitely that it was all up with me, that I was at the end of my tether,
                    irrevocably at the end. I felt and knew this as something unalterable.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and I had rented a studio with a wide
                    balcony in the neighbourhood of the <placeName>Piazza di Spagna</placeName>.
                    Every day I was ill, every day. And all the time the roses and the orange trees
                    were blooming in front of our studio window.</p>
                <p>"Now and then <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> appeared; but she had lost
                    all her gaiety. She wept every time. She realized how beautiful life could
                    be.</p>
                <p>"Sometimes <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> would weep as well.
                    Otherwise, she was perfectly well, even in <placeName>Rome</placeName>. She
                    tried to paint; but nothing would come of her efforts. When I lay awake at night
                    beside her, I observed that she too was lying with wide-open eyes. Our evenings
                    we passed with <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName>. His character, too,
                    underwent a gradual change. A fitful melancholy weighed upon him, even when he
                    tried to appear cheerful. He confessed that when all was said and done his life
                    had been a failure. He could understand men who had reached this conclusion
                    turning to the cloister as their last refuge. Undoubtedly there were such men,
                    even in the twentieth century. I perceived that his words were seriously
                    meant.</p>
                <p>"My thoughts wandered to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. Had she not
                    also missed her life's purpose? Had she not sacrificed herself so that I should
                    not live aloneâ€”because she felt that I had become a sick manâ€”because she knew
                    that she was the only person who could understand me? I knew that no earthly
                    power could induce her to leave meâ€”to-day less than ever. She was still young
                    now. She still had</p>
                <pb n="117"/>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">104</num></p>
                <p>time to catch up with many of the opportunities she had missed for my sake. For
                    me life had no longer any attraction. I know this is a shallow thing to say, for
                    others, but for me it said and comprised everything. Why should I drag out a
                    miserable existence any longer? No doctor could discover what was the matter
                    with me, nobody could help me. To go on living, ill and old before my time . . .
                    the idea was too horrible to contemplate. I thought all this out without any
                    feeling of self-commiseration. And thus the idea presented itself quite
                    naturally: better dead. Then <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> would be
                    free. Then life would have still many rich years in store for her. That evening
                    in <placeName>Rome</placeName> I took a resolution. It still holds good. Only
                    one thing can alter it.</p>
                <p>"It was then May. I gave myself a year's reprieve. If in the course of this year
                    I should not find a doctor who could help meâ€”who would try to save <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>â€”to separate her from meâ€”I know how difficult
                    it is for others to understand these words, to separate <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> from meâ€”but how else shall I express the idea? Well, if I
                    could not by the following May find this helper, then I would take a silent
                    farewell from this existence, even if the other being who was obliged to share
                    this existence with me in one body must also share my fate. I even appointed the
                    day. It was to be the first of May. And I determined to carry out my design as
                    discreetly as was possible to both of usâ€”<persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> and Iâ€”in order to spare <persName key="sparreGre"

                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. . . . How to spare her? That was the
                    hardest thing of all. I knew only too well how <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> would take a forcible termination of my life.</p>

                <p>But despite all my consideration and solicitude for the best and truest friend of
                    my life, I realized that there was no other way out. It would, however, be a
                    release for us both, and certainly the only one that was possible.</p>
                <p>"Once I had taken this decision I felt relieved. Now I knew that there would be
                    an end of this torture within a measurable period of time.</p>
                <p>"My health worsened from day to day. And the moment came when <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> perceived that I could not remain in
                        <placeName>Rome</placeName> any longer, that a return to
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName>, where we knew some trustworthy doctors, was
                    urgently necessary.</p>
                <p>"Unutterably depressed, we left <placeName>Rome</placeName>â€”and <persName
                        key="feruzziRi">Ridolfo Feruzzi</persName>â€”one sunny spring morning much
                    earlier than we had planned.</p>
                <p>"In <placeName>Paris</placeName>, in our native environment, my condition
                    apparently improved. Again we visited a few specialists, but always with a
                    negative result. Eventually a radiologist took me in hand. The treatment almost
                    cost me my life, and I was nearly relieved of the necessity of despatching
                    myself on the appointed first of May.</p>
                <p>"As the Parisian summer was too warm, we withdrew to
                        <placeName>Versailles</placeName>, in the neighbourhood of the Park
                    <!-- is this a placeName? -->. Our life resumed its normal course. Neither
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> nor I were fond of making much
                    fuss about our weal and woe, our joys and sorrows. Work is the best doctor, I
                    said to myself. And as often as my condition permitted, I went into the Park
                    with my paintbox and easel, just as I did in former years. And <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName> came as often as she liked, to distract
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and herself.</p>

                <p>perception of my condition was <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude
                        Lejeune</persName>. At that period he was a comforter to us both. Without
                    the need of many words, he divined what was concealed behind the apparent calm
                    which <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and Iâ€”and <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>â€”showed him on all his visits. When he came on
                    Sunday, the old gaiety reigned once more among us.</p>
                <p>"If we had not had <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude Lejeune</persName> at
                    that time . . .</p>
                <p>"He, like <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, had long realized that the
                    only thing that was still vital within me was <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>. This they believed firmly. And hence they both encouraged
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> to come as often as she liked.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude Lejeune</persName> often took long walks
                    with her through the <placeName>Park of Versailles</placeName>
                    <!-- not marked in the schema -->, forging plans for the future.</p>
                <p>"On one such evening, when the setting sun had turned to molten gold all the
                    windows of the palace and the smooth surface of the water in the pond, they were
                    strolling arm in arm along the terrace. Suddenly they heard a lady say to her
                    companion in passing: 'Look! Two happy people!'</p>
                <p>"Most of our friends and acquaintances understood my condition much better than
                    all the doctors whom we had consulted. Of course, their sympathy was limited to
                    words. Nevertheless, their words often gave me moral support. They saw in me an
                    overweighted man, whose sufferings were a real martyrdom, and not, as the French
                    doctors declared over and over again, imagination and hysteria.</p>
                <p>"One day I met an elderly French painter in <placeName>Trianon</placeName>. We
                    had known each other for years, but had not seen each other for a long time.

                <p>inquired sympathetically after my health. I answered evasively, without betraying
                    the least hint of the real state of the case.</p>
                <p>"To my astonishment he made answer in my place.</p>
                <p>"I have been observing you for some time, without your having noticed it, here in
                    the Park <!-- placeName? -->, when you are painting. I have been struck with the
                    complete change that has come over you during recent years. Formerly you gave
                    one the fresh, sharp impression of a healthy man. Now, if you will pardon my
                    saying so, the effect you have on me is for all the world like that of a girl
                    impersonating a man. You are ill. You are even very ill. You are undergoing a
                    transformation. It is a fantastic idea; but what had never been before may
                    become actuality to-morrow. We have known of cases of inversion for a long time,
                    and doctors can deal with them. Why shouldn't you also be helped. It is to be
                    hoped you will find a courageous and imaginative doctor. Everything depends on
                    this. Of course, you will wonder how a poor painter can find the enormous fee
                    for such an undertaking. Let us hope, nevertheless, that you will find a man
                    prepared to assist you for humane and scientific reasons.'</p>
                <p>"These and similar expressions of understanding were like little oases in my
                    progress through the desert, and they gave me courage and strength to prolong
                    yet a little further my hopeless quest of a saviour.</p>
                <p>"During this last summer at <placeName>Versailles</placeName> I began to notice
                    that when I was standing in the street, or walking in the
                    Park<!-- placeName? -->, people often stared at me</p>
                <pb n="123"/>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">109</num></p>
                <p>in astonishment, even in the shops which I had been accustomed to visit for
                    years. I had occasionally been aware of the same thing in
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName> during recent years, but never to the same
                    extent as was now the case in <placeName>Versailles</placeName>. Moreover,
                    Parisians are the most cultivated, the most indifferent and the most blasÃ©
                    people in the world, while the Versaillese are semi-provincial.</p>
                <p>"One morning when I wanted to reach the Park <!-- placeName? -->quickly, in order
                    to paint, I took a short cut through a corridor of the <placeName>HÃ´tel des
                        Reservoirs</placeName>, where several young waiters were standing.</p>
                <p>"I scarcely noticed them, but I had only gone a few steps when I heard behind me
                    in pure <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName> slang the words: 'Look at that smart
                    girl in trousers going to paint!'</p>
                <p>"Incidentally I may observe that the hotels in <placeName>Versailles</placeName>
                    are full of Danish waitersâ€”I do not know why. Probably because German and
                    Austrian waiters were mainly employed before the War, and, no doubt, owing to
                    their knowledge of languages.</p>
                <p>"Enough! I behaved as if I had heard nothing, but went on my way pondering on the
                    meaning of this complimentâ€”and then it began to dawn on me why I had attracted
                    attention everywhere in recent times.</p>
                <p>"A few days later the wife of our house porter, with whom I was on the best of
                    terms, called me aside and said: '<persName>Monsieur</persName> must not be
                    angry with me if I confide to <persName>Monsieur</persName> that the shopkeepers
                    in the neighbourhood where Madame and <persName>Monsieur</persName> make their
                    purchases will not believe that <persName>Monsieur</persName> is a monsieur.'

                <p>of her head and mouth wide open she stood stock still while I answered with a
                    smile: 'Madame, I am very much inclined to agree with the shopkeepers.'</p>
                <p>"These and similar incidents showed me that the situation was beginning to be
                    paradoxical. <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> could not show herself in
                    the street on her own account, because she and I shared the same bodyâ€”although
                    not a soul took any notice of her whenever she walked abroad, apart from
                    occasional pursuers. I, on the other hand, was stared at everywhere. Although I
                    was dressed perfectly correctly as a man and took long masculine strides, people
                    took me for a girl masquerading as a man.</p>
                <p>"It was not to be endured.</p>
                <p>"In the autumn, when we returned to <placeName>Paris</placeName>, I noticed that
                    I was beginning to attract attention there also, although it mostly found
                    expression in a somewhat more discreet manner. In the tube, or in the 'bus, or
                    in the tram, I frequently caught looks and words from people who were watching
                    me. The few remarks that I occasionally overheard were enough to convince me
                    that the opinion of the shopkeepers in <placeName>Versailles</placeName> was
                    shared by others. With my thorough knowledge of the sophistication of Parisians
                    in general it became doubly clear to me that I was really on the way to becoming
                    a sensationâ€”and this fact made me more and more nervous. My nerves, which had
                    been weakened by the sufferings of long years, simply revolted: they could no
                    longer bear the sight of me pursued everywhere by wondering and curious
                    grimaces. This molestation by my fellows utterly depressed me.</p>
                <pb n="125"/>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">110</num></p>
                <p>"Thus I went again to the heart specialist with whom I was acquainted. <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had called on him a few days before and had
                    tried to explain to him my and <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>'s double
                    lifeâ€”and he had promised her to take me to another specialist in
                        <placeName>Versailles</placeName>â€”although, personally, he regarded the
                    whole thing as a fixed idea of mine, and exclusively as a 'diseased imagining
                    without any physical foundation'.</p>
                <p>"'Your husband is healthy. His body is normal. I am speaking from a thorough
                    knowledge, from a thorough examination of his body, madame.' Such was the wisdom
                    of his concluding remarks.</p>
                <p>"This visit to the new specialist in <placeName>Versailles</placeName> was to be
                    my last experiment, I had solemnly sworn to <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> and myself, before we set out on the journey. On my
                    arrival I immediately received the impression that the two doctors had settled
                    their plan of campaign in advance: they wanted to try to drive out of me my
                    hysterical crochets and whims. After an extremely superficial examination I was
                    told point blank that I was a perfectly normal man without any defect whatever,
                    and that all I had to do was to try to behave as a man with energy and good
                    humour, in order to be able to lead once more the life of an ordinary man <hi
                        rend="italic">masculini generis</hi>. During this summary of their profound
                    judgment they regarded me with scarcely veiled irony: they looked upon me as an
                    hysterical subject, plainly as a fraud, and one of them, the 'new specialist',
                    even hinted that I was really homosexual. This suggestion almost broke down my
                    self-control. If <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had not saved the
                    situation by a ringing laugh, repudiating on my behalf</p>
                <pb n="126"/>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">111</num></p>
                <p>the supposition as utterly absurd, I should have seized the fellow by the
                    throat.</p>
                <p>"After this hopeless consultation, which profoundly depressed us both, my last
                    reserves of strength were exhausted. And I swore to myself that henceforth no
                    power on earth would induce me to consult new doctors. I would not run the risk
                    of being degraded again for the amusement of the medicos.</p>
                <p>"I said to myself that as my case has never been known in the history of the
                    medical art, it simply did not exist, it simply could not exist. Thus my doom,
                    which was also <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>'s doom, was sealed. All
                    that now remained for me to do was to go on living with all the patience that I
                    could muster until the short term that I had set to my life had expired.</p>
                <p>"Outwardly, nothing changed in the routine of our daily life. I was even cheerful
                    when friends or acquaintances visited us, but particularly so in my behaviour
                    towards <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, as I was afraid that she
                    might see through me. That she was seriously perturbed I could divine from her
                    whole attitude. She kept her feelings well under control, and generally showed
                    me a smiling countenance, behind which she was able to hide her despondency. She
                    had become so restless. Frequently, when she believed that I was not observing
                    her, she would look at me furtively with an air of such strange inquiry that I
                    feared she suspected my plans.</p>
                <p>"During these weeks I had only one desire: to hear music. Concerts I could no
                    longer attend, as I dared not see people. Consequently, I bought large numbers
                    of gramophone records, classical and modern music, all mixed up anyhow, and
                    during</p>

                <p>long evenings our gramophone played until far into the night. I swallowed
                    everything that was musicâ€”gay and tragic, the most banal and the most solemn,
                    the most melodious and the most discordant musicâ€”provided only it were music. It
                    was my comforter, whether it moved me to tears or prompted me to join merrily in
                    some chorus, or even invite <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> to dance
                    with me.</p>
                <p>"At that time I lived on music. If I could not sleep, I fled to music. If I was
                    unable to open my eyes in the morning, <persName key="sparreGre"

                    It was not that I was abnormally receptive or sensitive. I was never less
                    sensitive that at this time. I merely felt utterly lost, abandoned to a fate
                    which transcended human understanding. Music, the language of the soul,
                    liberated me. Not to have to speak myself, not to have to give shape to my
                    hopeless brooding, not to think myself nor clothe my vague ideas in words, was
                    my daily and nightly prayer.</p>
                <p>"Formerly I had found distraction in reading. Now I never opened a book. What
                    were the fates of strange persons to me, unless I could find consolation in
                    reading about a person of my own kind? But of such a person no author had been
                    able to write, because it had never occurred to any author that such a person
                    could ever have existed. How could the philosophies of the Greeks and of the
                    present time assist me, which only tell us of the thoughts of men and of the
                    thoughts of women in separate bodies and brains and souls?

                        rend="italic">two</hi> beings, separate from each other, unrelated to each
                    other, hostile to each other, although they had compassion on each other, as
                    they knew that this body had room only for one of them.</p>
                <p>"One of these two beings had to disappear, or else both had to perish. During
                    these nights I was obsessed by the delusion that this body did not belong to me
                    alone, that my share in this body grew less day by day, as it enclosed in its
                    interior a being which demanded its existence at the price of my existence. I
                    seemed to myself like a deceiver, like a usurper who reigned over a body which
                    had ceased to be his, like a person who owned merely the faÃ§ade of his
                    house.</p>
                <p>"Now and then <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> would still appear, and
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was delighted every time she
                    came. <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> was gayer than I. Both of us knew
                    this. And <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> knew it was in her power to
                    comfort <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. Sometimes, at <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s request, she remained for several days.
                    In <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>'s company <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> was more easily able to bear the nights. <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName> could fall asleep more easily. And when she
                    slept, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, too, was able to sleep.
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> often wept without <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> remarking it. <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> had always possessed her own dream world. She had always
                    had such delightful dreams. Now her dreams had vanished. They revisited her just
                    for a few nights. And every dream was a continuation of the previous one. It was
                    winter, and she would dream of a coming spring which was very sunny. She told
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> these dreams, but she felt that
                    they were only dreams. And then would come fear. The next night, however, a

                <p>dream would drive her fear away. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> once
                    told me that she had secretly recorded many of these dreams in her diary. And
                    she said this as if she were betraying a secret.</p>
                <p>"'<persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> has dreamed you a romance,' I said to
                    her, and turned empty away.</p>
                <p>"But this dream-romance became the favourite subject of conversation between
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> during those dark days, and these talks were the only thing
                    that gave <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName> new courage and kept alive their hope that a
                    miracle would somehow happen.</p>
                <p>"Thus we reached February. <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> and
                        <persName key="rossiniEr">Ernesto</persName> were in

                    two months it will be the first of May. That is the extreme limit of the period
                    which I gave myself. Then <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>
                    will exist no longer. Whether <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> will

                <p>When <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> entered his hotel, it was almost
                    morning. He stood at the window of his bedroom and gazed down at the square in
                    front of the railway station. A number of taxi-cabs were there, a few belated
                    pedestrians. A gleam of light was visible from the glass wall of the long narrow
                    booking-hall.</p>
                <p>He was very tired.</p>
                <p>Slowly he undressed. He stood nude in front of the mirror. He thought of an
                    expression he had used that evening: "I am like one who only owns the faÃ§ade of
                    his house." The mirror in front of him showed him the faÃ§ade. It was the
                    unblemished body of a man.</p>
                <p>After a few hours he awoke in a cheerful humour, took a bath, breakfasted,
                    punctually paid, one after another, his last visits to the various doctors, and
                    felt almost carefree. In the middle of the <placeName>Leipziger
                        Strasse</placeName> he heard a child's voice whisper: "Look, mamma, a woman
                    in man's clothes." He turned round, and encountered a frightened look in two
                    girlish eyes, probably a ten-year-old, with a thick, fair pigtail; the child
                    blushed a fiery red and clutched hold of her mother, who regarded him with as
                    much astonishment as her daughter, and then hurried along with the child. </p>
                <p>A remarkable feeling of grim defiance welled</p>

                <p>up in him. Without meaning to do so, or even being aware of his action, he
                    remained standing in front of a shop window, gazing inquiringly at his own
                    reflection in the smooth plate-glass window. Irritably he muttered to himself.
                    "There is nothing more to be done with me. There is nothing more to be done with
                    me." Several times he repeated this sentence, and then looked at his watch. It
                    was half past four in the afternoon, and at five o'clock he had to be in
                        <persName key="gebhard">Professor Gebhard</persName>'s sanatorium.</p>
                <p>He found himself in <placeName>Potsdamer Platz</placeName>
                    <!-- not in the schema -->and entered the post-office. In the huge telephone
                    directory he looked up the number of <persName key="schildtBar">Baroness
                        Schildt</persName>, whom he really ought to have visited before, and asked
                    to be connected. She was not at home. He despatched a few hasty lines by
                    post:</p>
                <p>"Dear Baroness,</p>
                <p>"Do not be angry if you should not see me again. In a few minutes I shall be
                    calling a taxi and proceeding to my own funeral-tomb, <persName key="gebhard"
                        >Professor Gebhard</persName>'s sanatorium. Whatever happens, think kindly
                    of me. And if <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> should alone survive, do
                    not let her be quite alone. I know that not all my men friends are her friends,
                    but I should like her to inherit my women friends."</p>
                <p>He threw the letter into the bag of the postman who was just emptying the blue
                    pillar-box. He pressed a shilling into the worthy fellow's hand. The postman
                    looked at him astonished. Before the man could thank him, <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was in the</p>

                <p>nearest taxi. He gave the driver the exact address of the nursing-home, and
                    punctually at five o'clock entered the sanatorium.</p>
                <p>He was immediately led to the house-surgeon, who regarded him with a benevolent
                    mien.</p>
                <p>"I have just had a long telephonic conversation with my colleague
                        <persName>Kreutz</persName> about your case," the Professor began.
                    "Previously I had been talking to <persName key="arns">Doctor Arns</persName>
                    about it. He will be present at the operation which I have to perform. I should
                    now like to have the opportunity of making your acquaintance. A personal
                    impression is always very desirable."</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> answered to the point: "Please,
                    Professor, ask me what you like." But the Professor preferred a physical
                    examination to all questions, requested him to undress and lie down upon an
                    adjacent sofa of a type which had become very familiar to him since he had been
                    in <placeName>Berlin</placeName>.</p>
                <p>"Yes," declared the Professor, after making a detailed examination, "in yourself
                    you are entirely what you represent yourself to be in civic life, a man, but at
                    the same time your body undoubtedly shows a female conformation. I am surprised
                    at the state of affairs." And while <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>
                    was dressing himself again, the surgeon paced the room thoughtfully, regarded
                    the patient without pausing, glanced at his diary, and then said: "I know you
                    are in a hurry. Come early to-morrow morning." </p>
                <p>"That is not convenient, because I am to be photographed by <persName>Doctor
                        Hardenfeld</persName> at eleven o'clock to-morrow morning before the
                    operation, at <persName>Professor Kreutz</persName>'s wishes."</p>
                <p>"Good," declared <persName key="gebhard">Professor Gebhard</persName>, after</p>

                <p><num style="page">118</num></p>
                <p>again consulting his diary; "four o'clock in the afternoon will also be
                    convenient. To-day is Monday . . . then to-morrow, Tuesday, afternoon."</p>
                <p>"So we have a further reprieve," he said to himself, and looked at his watch. It
                    was nearly half past six. A taxi-cab was in the neighbourhood. He gave the
                    driver the name of his hotel, and spent this last night of all alone in the
                    hotel bedroom. He felt that his body and nerves could not stand any more strain
                    that dayâ€”yesterday's sleepless night, the conversation which had preceded it,
                    the noisy, strange giant city all around him.</p>
                <p>"I am no longer a player myself. I am only a substitute for <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. I must therefore be sparing."</p>
                <p>Tuesday morning <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> left his hotel early.
                    It was a bright March day; he strolled along the
                        <placeName>Friedrichstrasse</placeName>, then turned into the broad highway
                    of <persName>Unter den Linden</persName>, and found himself in the
                        <placeName>Pariser Platz</placeName>, facing the smooth, austere
                        <placeName>Brandenburg Gate</placeName>. This beautiful and almost
                    classically perfect perspective was bathed in the keen, bright sunshine of
                    March. The painter awoke in him. He went into the
                        <placeName>Tiergarten</placeName>. Sunshine and budding vegetation
                    everywhere. And the dead leaves were glistening like bronze. He strolled along a
                    path which led to a lake, on which ducks were swimming. The branches of lofty
                    trees were reflected on the surface of the water.</p>
                <p>He had never been there before. He absorbed the picture. He thought of the many
                    morning hours of his past life as a painter, spent far from towns and people,
                    and he blessed the fate which had made him a painter, a creature of utter</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">119</num></p>
                <p>simplicity who surrendered himself fully to the enjoyment of the moment. Not to
                    lose this precious moment was the impulse which found release when he painted.
                    He usually painted feverishly, and could scarcely wait to catch the picture
                    while it presented itself to his gaze, this gaze which was purified by the winds
                    of travel, which saw more than the vacant stare of others, and which was
                    brighter than that of others. Clairvoyant. How fond he had always been of this
                    word, and how it recurred to him at this moment!</p>
                <p>He had always been one with this intangible and restless something, this play of
                    light and shade, of claire-obscure, with colour and form. His attitude had been
                    like that of a sly bird-stalker who laid in ambush and knew all the calls that
                    would allure what he sought.</p>
                <p>Thus he had created his pictures, spellbound on the dead canvas with dead
                    colours, until what he had divined with his eyes suddenly began to take on a
                    life of its own. . . . Captured echoes, he had then usually confessed to
                    himself. My pictures are only feeble echoes . . . He had been happy and very
                    humble, like an initiate. And these hours had been the only real and genuine
                    joys of his life. These joys had belonged to him, to him alone, he could not
                    have shared them with, nor could he have stolen them from, any other person.
                    They had been exclusively <hi rend="italic">his</hi> wealth, <hi rend="italic"
                        >his</hi> property. Could he transmit this property, this wealth? This
                    question had never occurred to him before. Can one transmit joy? The joy of
                    painting? For him, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>, these
                    joys had gone beyond recall. And if <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>

                    heritage this joy, this blissful feeling of creative capacity, as a slight
                    compensation for the life he had stolen from her, for the many youthful years he
                    had deprived her of? His consciousness of guilt which so often weighed heavily
                    upon him would be thereby lessened.</p>
                <p>He must now think of <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, who had such
                    different inclinations from his; but why now think of inheritance? What great
                    thing had he ever accomplished? True, he possessed a small token which he had to
                    share with nobody: the golden "palm" of the <placeName key="ecoleBeauxarts"
                        >Paris Academy</placeName>. Oh, vanity!</p>
                <p>He wondered whether it was not time to return. He was standing upon an elegant
                    lightly balanced bridge, whence he could look over a wide canal which poured its
                    masses of water over a sluice drawn half-way up, so that it hissed and glittered
                    like a miniature waterfall.</p>
                <p>"I am just like one who is trying to sail under a waterfall," he reflected, "and
                    I feel the current catching hold of me, and I no longer know whither the voyage
                    is leading. Perhaps into complete destruction. . . . Yet . . . now, half-way,
                    the boat cannot be left. The resolution is taken. I cannot go back."</p>
                <p>Half an hour later he was at <persName>Dr. Hardenfeld</persName>'s, waiting for
                    the photographer.</p>
                <p>A lady, <persName>Hardenfeld</persName>'s assistant, then came to him in the
                    waiting-room, and began a conversation with him. He merely listened. She was
                    tactful, and he felt that whatever she said was not dictated by curiosity or
                    importunity.</p>

                <p> "Your case is a novelty for us here. And what adds to the interest which we take
                    in you for scientific reasons is the fact that you are an artist, an
                    intellectual, and therefore able to analyse your own feelings, your own
                    emotional life. You will experience the unprecedented and incredible thing:
                    first to have lived and felt as a man, and then to live and feel as a woman. I
                    am reminded of that Roman emperor who took his life because he could not achieve
                    what is now <hi rend="italic">your</hi> fate."</p>
                <p>At length the photographer arrived. When <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> left <persName>Dr. Hardenfeld</persName>'s institution,
                    he invited himself to a "farewell breakfast". With great care he selected an
                    appropriate restaurant for this purpose in the West End <!-- placeName? -->.</p>
                <p>Then he repaired to his hotel, paid his bill, and proceeded to
                        <placeName>Thomasiusstrasse</placeName>, to bid farewell to his friends.</p>
                <p>"You don't look exactly like a victim," affirmed friend
                        <persName>Niels</persName> the moment he entered the room.</p>
                <p>"Nor do I feel like oneâ€”on the contrary," laughed <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>.</p>
                <p>While <persName>Inger</persName> wrung her hands: "But, <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>, in a few hours you are going to be operated upon, and
                    you come here with a cigar in your mouth almost as black as a crow."</p>
                <p>Before he was aware of her action, she had snatched the cigar out of his
                    hand.</p>
                <p>"Please, I have just come from the last meal before my execution, or, speaking
                    more correctly, I have celebrated in the most literal meaning of the words the
                        <hi rend="italic">enterrement de ma vie de garÃ§on</hi>."</p>
                <p><persName>Inger</persName> took his hand. "I have not been a nurse for nothing; I
                    know how one should behave before</p>

                <p>an operation. Certainly not as you are doing, <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>. It is a stupid boyish trick to go and feast. It is
                    putting on airs. And now <persName>Niels</persName> will go with you to the
                    nursing-home."</p>
                <p>And so it fell out. Without a cigar, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>
                    entered the sanatorium under his friend's supervision.</p>
                <p>The operation sister received the two gentlemen, conducted them to a room next to
                    the operating-theatre, the door of which stood open. A few nurses appeared to be
                    making everything ready for a new operation. A strong odour pervaded the
                    place.</p>
                <p><persName key="gebhard">Professor Gebhard</persName> was, unfortunately, unable
                    to arrive until nearly six o'clock, and the gentlemen must therefore have a
                    little patience. They would be notified in due course.</p>
                <p>The time was scarcely four. <persName>Niel</persName>'s face assumed an
                    expression of utter despair. "I can't stand waiting here two hours," he said
                    almost contritely, and intimated that he would like to spend the period of
                    waiting with the patient in the large cafÃ© situated close at hand.</p>
                <p>When they had found seats in the cafÃ© opposite the newspaper stand, <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> detected a few yards away from them a
                    red-haired cripple, a newspaper boy. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>
                    sprang up in a trice and moved backwards towards the cripple, who observed this
                    proceeding with astonishment, for which he received a shilling from <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, and then another shilling after <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had touched his very solid hump.</p>
                <p>"My dear <persName>Niels</persName>," he then said by way of answer to his
                    friend's astonished look, "I call that friendship! To bring me in the presence
                    of such a splendid</p>

                <p>hump at the eleventh hour. For you know, of course, that such a fellow infallibly
                    brings one luck. A superstition, for aught I care, but now I feel invulnerable.
                    To touch a manly hump works wonders, but a female hump the contrary."</p>
                <p>"Which we will whet with a noble drop of Rhenish wine, as a burial drink so to
                    speak, according to the good old Nordic custom." And already <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had ordered from the head waiter a bottle
                    of the very best vintage. "But three glasses, please." </p>
                <p>"Three?" enquired <persName>Niels</persName>.</p>
                <p>"Of course; the cripple must drink with us." Nor did the red-haired fellow want
                    asking twice. "The like of us is used to plenty of sorrow," replied the
                    hunchback, making a low bow. He seized the proffered glass, and clinked it with
                    that of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>: "Your health, my dear sir.
                    May your good soul long survive you!"</p>
                <p>"The fellow speaks like a prophet," cried <persName>Niels</persName>. But
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> clasped the red-haired cripple
                    in his arms, then released the astonished man and raised his glass. "So be it!"
                    And he clinked his glass with that of the hunchback. When <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and <persName>Niels</persName> at length
                    departed, the red-haired cripple gazed after them, shaking his head.</p>
                <p>In the room of the nursing-home which was awaiting <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> lights were already burning. A nurse ushered him in,
                    took the patient's personal particulars, hung a thermometer over the bed, and
                    requested <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> to lie down immediately.
                    The doctors would soon put in an appearance.</p>
                <p>"I suppose it is best that I should go at once," inquired
                        <persName>Niels</persName>.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> nodded. "Well, old chap, so long,
                    and I</p>
                <pb n="141"/>

                <p>will do all I can to fulfil the red-haired fellow's prophecy."</p>
                <p><persName>Niels</persName> was about to say something more, but <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> pushed him to the door. A brief handshake,
                    and <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was alone.</p>
                <p>He paced up and down. Once, twice, thrice. Without knowing it he began to count
                    his steps. So the room was seven paces long and six paces wide. Then he sat on
                    the bed. He regarded the room. A room in a nursing-home like countless others.
                    Bright walls, and bed and table and cupboard and the two chairs likewise painted
                    a light colour.</p>
                <p>And then he began to undress very slowly. Suddenly it occurred to him that he,
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>, was probably undressing
                    for the last time . . . that what was now taking place was a farewell to coat
                    and waistcoat and trousers and so on and so on. For a lifetime these coverings
                    of coat and waistcoat and trousers had enclosed him. He contemplated the
                    articles of clothing, one after another, as he took them off; he hung the coat
                    over the waistcoat, and then both upon the hanger in the cupboard, as he had
                    been accustomed to do since . . . yes, since when? He stretched the trousers in
                    the trouser-press, and looked at one article after another, and stroked each in
                    turn. "What will become of you? What will become of me? Which of us here will
                    survive the other? Iâ€”myself? Iâ€”you? . . . Coat, waistcoat, trousers, shoes,
                    underclothes, socks. . . ."</p>
                <p>And he picked up his hat off the table. "You too. I had almost forgotten you. Who
                    else have I forgotten?" And he slipped his hand in the inside</p>

                <p>pocket of his coat, took out a picture, and stood it on the table against the
                    wall. "<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>," he said, and started to
                    stroke the picture. A knock was heard and the door was opened. <persName
                        key="gebhard">Professor Gebhard</persName> entered, accompanied by his
                    assistant doctor. A few questions were addressed to <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>, with the result that, to his surprise, the performance
                    of the "first operation", which involved no danger whatever, as the Professor
                    explained, had to be postponed to the following morning. "'<hi rend="italic"
                        >Gravol</hi>' is what you call such farewell celebrations in the North,"
                    laughed the Professor. "Your friend has already betrayed to me the Rhenish wine.
                    Congratulations! You seem to know your way about there. But operations of this
                    kind are best performed on an empty stomach. In a few hours' time we will give
                    you a sleeping-draught, so that the time between now and to-morrow morning will
                    not seem too long to you. And now, courage." A handshakeâ€”and <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was again alone.</p>
                <p>"So it's always wait, wait, wait, wait," he said to himself. "However, much
                    patience must one have," he said, addressing the portrait which stood on the
                    table next to his bed.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>." . . . More he could not say; he
                    leaned back on the white pillows, stared at the ceiling, and felt tired.</p>
                <p>He had struggled to the goal. He became sensible of the bustle of the day here in
                        <placeName>Berlin</placeName>. Now he had to confess that he was at the end
                    of his forces. And the last remnant of his masculine pride, which he had been
                    dragging about with him in this strange million-headed city like a cuirass, fell
                    away from him.</p>

                <p>No weakness . . . stick it out.</p>
                <p>He had laid a writing-pad and fountain-pen on the table. He took a sheet of paper
                    and wrote:</p>

                    is only a minor one, involving no danger. Consequently I have not besought you
                    to come to me. Should it, however, turn out otherwise, I will tell you now that
                    I shall have thought only of you every hour, every minute up to the last moment.
                    My last wish is that your future should be happyâ€”that you should inherit my

                <p>When <persName>Inger</persName> entered his room an hour later, he gave her the

                    in case.</p>
                <p>"You great booby, I have known all along from <persName>Niels</persName> that

                    said: "This is the luckiest day I have had."</p>

                <p>morning, when the doctors were expected to arrive. He had hardly time to make a
                    hasty toilet before <persName key="arns">Professor Arns</persName> was standing
                    beside the bed and requesting him to sign a declaration that he, <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>, desired to be operated upon at his
                    own risk, and that <persName key="gebhard">Professor Gebhard</persName> was
                    relieved of all responsibility in the event of an unfavourable outcome.</p>
                <p>"With pleasure," he declared, and he immediately signed the document which was
                    addressed to some high authority, and which said in effect: "In case I die, I
                    renounce all right to make any difficulties hereafter." "But may I not add a few
                    words of thanks to the German doctors," he asked suddenly, "who are going to
                    make an attempt to save me?"</p>
                <p>This request was laughingly declined, and then the Professor announced: "The

                        <persName>Professor Kreutz</persName>, so good luck." He then withdrew.</p>
                <p>When <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was again alone, he wrote yet

                <p>"At the last moment before my operation I yield to an impulse to express to you
                    my heartfelt thanks. Since the day when I met you in
                        <placeName>Paris</placeName> I have been hopeful, and here in
                        <placeName>Berlin</placeName>, where I know none of the doctors who have
                    examined me and assisted me, an invisible power seems to have smoothed all my
                    paths. I know that you are this invisible power, and that whatever good things
                    have come my way have emanated from you. Whatever the result</p>

                <p>may be, I want you to know that I am enormously grateful for all you have done
                    for me.</p>
                <p>"Your attached <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>."</p>
                <p>Now everything was in order.</p>
                <p>A moment later the assistant doctor entered the room.</p>
                <p>When <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> woke up again, in violent pain,
                    it was almost noon. He opened his eyes with a shriek. Gradually he realized that
                    he was lying in his bed. It seemed to him as if he had been crying out for a
                    long time, as if he were resisting something. Two nurses were standing beside
                    him and speaking soothing words. When he recovered consciousness he felt the
                    pains growing more violent. With an effort he regained control of himself and
                    clenched his teeth. He would leave off screaming. And, in fact, he screamed no
                    more.</p>
                <p>"Did I make much noise?" he inquired.</p>
                <p>"Well, just a little," said one of the nurses with a smile, "and the strange
                    thing was that your voice had completely changed. It was a shrill woman's
                    voice."</p>
                <p>Then <persName key="gebhard">Professor Gebhard</persName> came in and took
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> by the hand. "It went off
                    splendidly. Moreover, I must congratulate you. You have a splendid soprano
                    voice! Simply astounding."</p>
                <p>Towards the evening he was awakened by a fit of coughing. It seemed as if his
                    whole body were being torn asunder. The coughing was terrible. He had tried to
                    suppress it, but without success.</p>
                <p>At last the fit was over, and he lay exhausted. The nurses wiped the perspiration
                    off his forehead. "You must have smoked a lot?" she asked. "Perhaps even
                    yesterday."</p>

                <p>On the table by the bed lay a cigarette-case. </p>
                <p>"Throw them out of the window, Nurse. I will never put a cigarette or cigar in my
                    lips again." The nurse smilingly removed the cigarette-case. "Don't forget your
                    vow!"</p>
                <p>"I swear it to you and to me." And he thought of the cigar which
                        <persName>Inger</persName> had taken from him yesterday. It was the very
                    last cigar which <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had smoked.</p>
                <p>Fresh fits of coughing in the course of the evening deepened his sudden hatred of
                    tobacco to such an extent that the very idea of tobacco filled him with nausea.
                    And this fanatical aversion from the enjoyment of tobacco in every form he
                    inherited from <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. </p>
                <p><persName>Niels</persName> was admitted to him for a few moments. "You're going
                    on fine, what?" he began immediately.</p>
                <p>"Oh, yes." More than that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> could not
                    bring himself to say. <persName>Niels</persName> looked at the nurse in
                    astonishment.</p>
                <p>She whispered to him: "I suppose you are surprised at the clear voice."</p>
                <p><persName>Niels</persName> nodded. "I cannot recognize it."</p>
                <p>Then he sat on the one chair next to the bed. "<persName>Inger</persName> sends
                    you her greetings. Otherwise . . ." </p>
                <p>The nurse gave a hint. <persName>Niels</persName> stole out of the sick-room. And
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> whimpered: "Nurse, give me an
                    injection. . . ." It was not the only one he had during the night. It was an
                    endless agonizing night. Not until dawn did he manage to go off into a short
                    heavy sleep. By the time he was fully awake, about noon, he felt as weak as one
                    who had been wandering through a desert. But the pains seemed to have become
                    more remote.</p>

                <p>Only now and then the question would surge up in his mind, "Who am I? What am I?
                    What was I? What shall I become?"</p>
                <p>Soon afterwards <persName>Inger</persName> cameâ€”with flowers and a large bottle
                    of eau-de-Cologne. Flowers! How their scent transformed the sick-room!</p>
                <p>"Drench me with eau-de-Cologne, <persName>Inger</persName>! Sprinkle it all over
                    the room!" he cried, almost beside himself with joy.</p>
                <p>Then she sat on the bed next to him and began to talk in confident tones. She,
                    who had previously always addressed him as "you" now used the more intimate
                    "thou". He did not realize until many days later that during these first days
                    she never once called him by any name.</p>
                <p>Each day she came to see him with flowers and comforting words. So one day, two
                    days, three days passed. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> slept most
                    of the time. No dreams came to him in the long nights, through which he was
                    assisted by sedatives. And every morning <persName>Inger</persName> was with him
                    with fresh flowers.</p>
                <p>One day she brought with her a perfectly magnificent spring bouquet.</p>
                <p>"This time you must not thank me. The floral greetings are from a good
                    friend."</p>
                <p>"From <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude Lejeune</persName>?"</p>
                <p><persName>Inger</persName> nodded.</p>
                <p>She opened the note attached to the bouquet and read:</p>
                <p>"Each flower of my bouquet is a greeting to <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>."</p>
                <p>For a long time the flowers concealed the</p>

                <p>invalid's eyes, and even Inger could not see that his eyes were weeping scalding
                    tears.</p>
                <p>"Will <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> ever find her again?"</p>
                <p>"Whom?"</p>
                <p>"<persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>."</p>
                <p>Saying which, the invalid handed Inger a card, on which he had scribbled a few
                    lines.</p>
                <p>"Did you write this?" she asked.</p>
                <p>"Yes, Inger."</p>
                <p>"But then she is there already; <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>'s
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. Just look."</p>
                <p>He gazed at the card and failed to recognize his writing. It was a woman's
                    script.</p>
                <p>Inger hurried out and met the assistant doctor, who was standing in the corridor.
                    She showed him the card: "What do you think of this, Doctor. No man could have
                    written it?"</p>
                <p>"No," said the astonished doctor; "no, you are quite right. One thing after
                    another is pushing out." </p>
                <p>"One thing after another."</p>
                <p>Andreas distinctly heard the words.</p>
                <p>And the doctor answered: "Haven't you noticed the voice is completely altered? It
                    has changed from a tenor into a clear soprano."</p>
                <p>When <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was again alone, he spoke softly
                    to himself. He wanted to listen to his own voice. But drowsiness overcame him
                    and he fell asleep once more.</p>
                <p>He woke up suddenly in the middle of the night. A terrible shriek startled him.
                    At first he thought that he had himself screamed. He clenched his teeth. But the
                    screams were heard again. No, he had not screamed. It was like the shriek of a
                    tortured animal. He could not stand it any longer.</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>"Someone is being murdered! Help, help!" he cried, and reaching out his hand,
                    pressed the bell. The door was flung open, the light switched on. A nurse stood
                    in front of him. "What is the matter with you?" </p>
                <p>"With me?" Once more the screams rang out. </p>
                <p>"I was so terrified, Nurse. Is somebody dying?"</p>
                <p> The nurse closed the door and drew the heavy felt curtains along. . . . "A young
                    woman has given birth to a child. . . a sweet little girl. . . .I suppose you
                    never realized what a difficult thing childbirth is?" </p>
                <p>The next morning Inger arrived early.</p>
                <p>"Who do you think is coming in a day or two?" she cried, as she entered the
                    room.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>?"</p>
                <p>"Yes, here is her letter."</p>
                <p>He had to extract the letter from a huge bouquet, and was still reading it when
                        <persName key="gebhard">Professor Gebhard</persName>, accompanied by the
                    assistant doctor, came into the room.</p>
                <p>"Tell me, please, Doctor," exclaimed <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>,
                    "when shall I be able to get up?"</p>
                <p>"Why the haste? You are doing very well here in bed amid flowers and soft
                    hands."</p>
                <p>"But there is a hurry, Doctor. In three days my wife will arrive."</p>
                <p>"Your wife?" The Professor was taken aback. </p>
                <p>"All right, then, but have a little patience. Madame will certainly find you
                    somewhat changed."</p>
                <p>Then he hurriedly left the room with his companion.</p>
                <p>"Did I do anything absurd, Inger? The Professor looked at me with such an amused
                    expression."</p>
                <p>"Stupid <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>!" was the only answer that Inger
                    could think of.</p>

                <p>Three days later <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> arrived early in the
                    morning.</p>
                <p>The nurse on duty knew at once who she was.</p>
                <p>A few moments later she was in the sick-room. </p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> stood in the middle of the room with
                    outstretched arms, and could not stir. She was struggling with her tears. She
                    wanted to throw him a gay greeting, but sank down sobbing by the side of the
                    bed.</p>
                <p>Late in the evening, when she was alone with the turmoil of thoughts and
                    sensations that assailed her, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> wrote
                    the following letter to their friend in Paris, <persName key="lejeuneClaude"
                        >Claude Lejeune</persName>:</p>
                <p>"I can only hint at what I have been through to-day. I thought I should find
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> is dead, for I could not see him. I found a pale being.
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, and yet not Lili as we had known
                    her in Paris. It was another. New in voice and expression, new in the pressure
                    of her hand, unspeakably changed. Or was it a being who is in process of finding
                    herself? No doubt the latter is the case. So womanly and untouched by life. No,
                    womanly is not the right word. Maidenly, I ought to say. Perhaps childish,
                    fumbling with a thousand questions in the dark.</p>

                <p>A 'nova vita'. I cannot find words to express my meaning. I have been shaken to
                    my depths. What a fate, <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>! A fit
                    of uncanny shuddering grips me whenever I reflect upon it. It is a mercy that
                    Lili herself is too weak now to look backward or forward. She is hardly able to
                    realize the condition she is in at the moment. I spoke to the doctors.</p>
                <p>"The first operation, which only represents a beginning, has been successful
                    beyond all expectations. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had ceased
                    to exist, they said. His germ glandsâ€”oh, mystic wordsâ€”have been removed. What
                    has still to happen will take place in Dresden under the hands of Professor
                    Kreutz. The doctors talked about hormones; I behaved as if I knew what they
                    meant. Now I have looked up this word in the dictionary and find that it refers
                    to the secretions of internal organs which are important for vital processes.
                    But I am no wiser than I was before. Must one equip oneself, then, with wisdom
                    and knowledge in order to understand a miracle? I accept the miracle like a
                    credulous person.</p>
                <p>"What I found here in the nursing-home I would call the unravelling of the
                    beloved being whose life and torments those of us who have shared with him all
                    these many difficult years, have felt to be an insoluble riddle. Unravelling. .
                    . .That's what it is. But the unravelling is not yet finished. I know it, and
                    Lili suspects it. She is not yet allowed to see her lacerated body. It is bound
                    up, and to herself and probably also to the doctors is still a secret which only
                    Kreutz can unveil entirely.</p>

                <p>"Everybody here, the doctors, the nurses, our friends Niels and Inger, have
                    candidly expressed to me their astonishment at the almost miraculous outward
                    change in 'our patient'â€”for they do not rightly know whether they ought to
                    address this being as a man or a woman. What is their astonishment compared with
                    mine? They have been seeing the invalid every day. But I, who had been parted
                    from him only two weeks, should have scarcely recognized my beloved husband. And

                    in her voice: 'Are you not angry with me'â€” looking at me with so perplexed an
                    expressionâ€”'because <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> has robbed you
                    of your best years?' <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>, I was too
                    shocked to utter a wordâ€”and when at length I could have said what I felt, I
                    dared not do so. Not me, I thought, has <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> robbed, not me, but you, <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>, my sweet pale <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, of
                    all your girlish years. You and I, <persName key="lejeuneClaude"
                        >Claude</persName>, and all of us, must help to compensate Lili for the
                    fraud which <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> has practised on
                    her."'</p>
                <p>Many months later Lili read this letter. <persName key="lejeuneClaude"
                        >Claude</persName> gave it to her.</p>
                <p>The next morningâ€”<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had spent the
                    night</p>
                <p><num style="page">136</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>alone in an hotelâ€”the head nurse proposed to put another bed in the sick-room, so
                    that <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> could be near the patient until
                    the departure for Dresden, which was appointed to take place within a few
                    days.</p>
                <p>"Splendid!" whispered <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, delighted, and
                    taking the nurse by the hand she led her into an adjoining room, which stood
                    empty. Swiftly she fetched a trunk which she had left in the corridor, opened it
                    cautiously, and drew out a silk nÃ©gligÃ©e. </p>
                <p>"How becoming you will look in it, madam!" </p>
                <p>"I? No, Nurse; it is a present from our Parisian friend for ourâ€”patient inside.
                    But not a word, please, until to-morrow morning!"</p>
                <p>And when morning came it found Lili sitting in the most charming Parisian
                    nÃ©gligÃ©e, still very pale and limp, but nevertheless quite gay, in the white
                    sick-bed. And the assistant doctor could hardly believe his eyes. "Famous!
                    Congratulations, miss! And if you promise to be very good and careful you may
                    get up to-day for two hours and show yourself to your astonished friends. More
                    than this we cannot permit for the time being."</p>
                <p>One nurse after another rustled in. Their astonishment was unbounded.</p>
                <p>Such was the reception accorded in the Berlin nursing-home to the miracle
                    performed upon this still very fatigued human being, a reception unmingled with
                    curiosity or excessive inquiry; and when <persName key="gebhard">Professor
                        Gebhard</persName> paid a visit in the evening, he kissed the patient's
                    trembling hand as if it were the most natural thing in the world: "Good day,
                    mademoiselle," he said; "I congratulate you. You are on the right road.</p>

                <p>Then he noticed <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> for the first time.
                    "Ah, madam, welcome."</p>
                <p>For a moment the Professor and <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                    confronted each other mutely, not without suppressed emotions.</p>
                <p>Then Lili broke the silence. "Yes, Professor, this is Madame <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, who . . ."</p>
                <p>The Professor gave a good-humoured laugh. "I know; who was married to
                        <persName>Monsieur</persName>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>, who has slipped away from us
                    in such a miraculous manner. Men are deceivers ever, madame." And with this
                    happy expression the tension of a difficult situation was relieved.</p>
                <p>Lili surrendered herself to all this as if unconcerned, during her <hi
                        rend="italic">first</hi> Berlin days. Observers could detect in her scarcely
                    any trace of excitement, but rather a kind of relaxation. Moreover, she avoided
                    replying to any look of astonishment on the faces of others by a word or even a
                    gesture.</p>
                <p>"We must leave her in peace," <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> would
                    then say to them in confidence. "She is resting. She is in a kind of transition.
                    She is now getting ready to soar into freedom."</p>
                <p>During these days <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> began to keep a
                    diary. Every evening she recorded therein her observations, and the experiences
                    which crowded thickly upon her in the company of the new <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, in simple, almost fumbling sentences,
                    seeking the way of her friendâ€”this difficult, wonderful way upon which Lili had
                    scarcely ventured to take the first step. </p>
                <p>Here is a leaf from the diary that she started:</p>
                <p>"Lili bears everything with incredible patience. True, she whimpers every
                    morning, and even</p>
                <p><num style="page">138</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>when her bandages are changed, when fasteners must be undone and done up, and
                    when the still fresh scars are painted.</p>
                <p>"'This is all for my good,' she says with a patience which I have never seen her
                    display before. She has only one wish, to go to Dresden soon, to <hi
                        rend="italic">her</hi> Professor. She always calls him her Professor, or
                    else her miracle-man. About the past she does not say a single word. It often
                    seems to me as if she were without any past at all, as if she did not yet really
                    believe in a present, as if she had been waiting for Kreutz, her miracle-man, in
                    order to bring her to proper life."</p>
                <p>Here is another entry:</p>
                <p>"To-day Inger and I did some shopping without Lili knowing what we were about. We
                    must make some preparations for the journey to Dresden. In the afternoon we
                    returned to <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, bringing with us a big
                    cardboard box. 'Guess what we have brought you,' I said gaily. Lili regarded us
                    calmly, without a smile. 'I don't know.' That was her only answer. Then Inger
                    opened the box. 'Lili . . .' said Inger, spreading out the coat in front of
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, and showing her the silk lining.
                    Lili looked at the coat, and said: 'But Professor Kreutz will send me away if I
                    appear before him in this attire. He won't recognize me at all.' And her eyes
                    looked so sad. Really, they are always sad, even when she smiles. <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had quite different eyes. So had Lili in
                    Paris. I think the eyes of the Lili to-day are not yet quite awake. She does
                    not</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">139</num></p>
                <p>yet believe. . . . Or is it that she will not yet show that she believes?"</p>
                <p>On this day Lili wrote her first letter, to her <persName key="brotherChris"
                        >brother-in-law</persName> in Copenhagen.</p>
                <p>"Berlin,</p>
                <p>"14th March, 1930.</p>
                <p>"Dear <persName key="brotherChris">Christian</persName>,</p>
                <p>"It is now Lili who is writing to you. I am sitting up in my bed in a silk
                    nightdress with lace trimming, curled, powdered, with bangle, necklace, and
                    rings. Even my solemn Professor calls me <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>, and everybody compliments me upon my appearance; but I am
                    still feeling tired after the operation and the terrible nights that followed
                    it. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> has arrived, and has gone out to
                    buy me a warm coat, so that I can travel to Dresden next week. The operation
                    which has been performed here enables me to enter the clinic for women
                    (exclusively for women). And now I feel I have courage for the major operation.
                    A thousand thanks for the cheque. When we leave for Dresden, all letters will be
                    forwarded. Now I can say with a light heart: 'It matters not what pains await
                    me, as I am so happy, and in a few months I shall be quite well, a blooming
                    maiden.'</p>
                <p>Your <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>."</p>
                <p>"P.S.â€”I write this letter in great secrecy. Mention the matter to no one."</p>
                <p>It was wintry weather in Berlin when some days later <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>, muffled up in her new fur coat, was</p>
                <p><num style="page">140</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>allowed to leave the nursing-home for a few hours for the first time. The
                    Professor had "prescribed" for her an automobile drive. You must prepare every
                    day now for the long journey to Dresden," he explained. "Get some fresh air, mix
                    with people, gather new strength."</p>
                <p>Mix with people. . . . At these words Lili listened attentively. A secret fear
                    assailed her. She did not, however, betray her feelings. Niels and Inger came to
                    fetch her away with <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, who did not stir
                    from her side.</p>
                <p>When Lili was outside the nursing-home, firmly supported by Niels' arm, she was
                    again overcome with fear. She looked as apprehensive as a prisoner breathing
                    fresh air for the first time after a long spell of captivity. She glanced about
                    her timidly, as if she feared that everything around her was a deception.</p>
                <p>She hesitated to proceed.</p>
                <p>"Come now, child," said <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> softly to her.
                    "She is proud," laughed Niels, "and, of course, wants to go alone."</p>
                <p>"No, no," protested Lili in a frightened voice, "don't let me stand alone. Just a
                    moment more. I must just taste this air once more. This air . . ." </p>
                <p>When Lili was sitting in the car, huddled close to <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>, she closed her eyes. "Don't bother about me. I must first
                    get accustomed to all this."</p>
                <p>And thus she drove through the roaring life of the Kurfurstendamm, like a
                    somnambulist, silent and self-absorbed.</p>
                <p>The drive lasted two hours, and then <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                    put the tired invalid to bed again. She was scarcely able to peck at the food
                    that was brought her</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">141</num></p>
                <p>before she fell into a deep slumber, which lasted until the following
                    morning.</p>
                <p>About noon Niels called for them both. Lili was in much better spirits. "I shall
                    not bore you to-day, nor myself. I am really anxious to see people."</p>
                <p>"Aren't we such?" inquired Niels, amused.</p>
                <p>"But I mean strange peopleâ€”yes, I want to see strange people again."</p>
                <p>"A brilliant suggestion," declared Niels, who resolved that they should dine with
                    him, in order to celebrate the occasion. He stopped the car mysteriously outside
                    a telephone-box and descended. He wanted to inform Inger of his intention. And
                    wearing a still more mysterious expression he returned.</p>
                <p>In a quarter of an hour they reached their destination. Inger was waiting for the
                    party on the doorstep. She pressed a big bunch of roses into Lili's arms. "Be
                    brave, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. Now you will find what you are
                    longing for." And then they divulged to her that in the flat was a young lady
                    from Copenhagen, who knew neither <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> nor
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, norâ€”<persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>, and to whom they had announced the visit of "a
                    Frenchwoman imported direct from Paris."</p>
                <p>"For heaven's sake!" cried <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, almost
                    beside herself.</p>
                <p>"No contradiction. You must now play the imported Parisienne," declared Inger.
                    "My friend has been told that you understand neither German nor Danish. And she
                    does not understand a word of French. I have told her that you have just had a
                    serious illness, and are still a long way from</p>
                <p><num style="page">142</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>recovery. You understand neither German nor Danish." Niels had already taken the
                    reluctant Lili by the arm: "Go right in, my dear," he ordered, and before she
                    could recover her equilibrium, Lili was sitting in the deep armchair of his
                    study, the same armchair in which <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas
                        Sparre</persName> a few weeks before had confessed the story of his life
                    during the greater part of a night.</p>
                <p>Then the door opened and Karen Wardal, a young Copenhagen actress, whom <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and Lili had known for many years, stood in
                    front of <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. Lili thought that her heart
                    would burst. Her pale cheeks blushed crimson. Yet nobody observed any trace of
                    excitement in her.</p>
                <p>"May I introduce," began Inger with a smile, FrÃ¤ulein Karen Wardelâ€”Mademoiselle
                        <persName key="stuart">Julie Stuart</persName>." And then, turning to
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>: "You both know each other
                    already."</p>
                <p>"Of course we do!" cried Karen Wardel with enthusiasm. "How is your husband
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>?"</p>
                <p>And <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> explained that <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was very well indeed, but, owing to
                    pressure of work, had been unable to leave Paris. Lili sat still, listened
                    unconcerned at the conversation conducted in Danish, and answered every question
                    which Karen asked in Danish, and which was rapidly translated by <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> or Inger into the most elegant French.</p>
                <p>The maid announced dinner. Lili was escorted by Niels into the dining-room. The
                    conversation flowed from one language into another, and Lili behaved like a
                    perfect Parisienne, as if she had never heard a Danish word in her life. She
                    accepted as a matter of course Karen's compliments upon her "extremely chic
                    Parisian costume"â€”this time</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">143</num></p>
                <p>Niels played the interpreter, and in her delight at this extravagant praise of
                    her attire Lili forgot that her hastily improvised wardrobe was not of Parisian
                    origin at all, but had come from a Berlin costumier.</p>
                <p>She did not betray herself by even a look. True, she was obliged to bite her
                    tongue many times, when she was on the point of suddenly joining in the
                    conversation conducted in Danish. This comedy lasted nearly two hours. There was
                    a good deal of joking in Danish, and Lili did not laugh until the point of the
                    "Danish joke" had been translated to her in French.</p>
                <p>Then she could keep it up no longer. She was tired to death, and begged <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> to take her to her hotel.</p>
                <p>She bade a smiling farewell to FrÃ¤ulein Karen.</p>
                <p>"The next time we meet I shall murder the French language," the young actress
                    called after her. "Till our next meeting in Paris; and don't forget, <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, to give <persName>Monsieur <persName
                            key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName></persName> my kind regards."</p>
                <p>Niels accompanied <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and Lili to the
                    nursing-home.</p>
                <p>"Well," he said, when they were sitting in the car, "I should not have thought it
                    possible. Now I can believe in miracles!"</p>
                <p>Lili sank back utterly exhausted. In silence she let herself be driven again
                    through the roaring city, now twinkling with thousands and thousands of lights.
                    When the car stopped in front of the clinic, Niels had to carry Lili to her
                    room. He bore a sleeping burden.</p>
                <p>So ended Lili's first encounter with a strange person</p>
                <p><num style="page">144</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>"And she did not recognize me," she said sadly.</p>
                <p>"But, child," answered <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, smiling, "that
                    ought to make you glad. <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, my new
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, does not know anybody in the world
                    yet. You are starting life again."</p>
                <p>It did not yet dawn on <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> that Lili's
                    melancholy was inspired by fear of having no friends.</p>

                <p>The next morning news came from Professor Kreutz in Dresden. Everything was ready
                    for the patient's reception. If the patient's physical state allowed, the
                    journey to Dresden might be undertaken immediately. But before going it was
                    desirable to pay a visit to Doctor Karner, who had tested <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' blood barely a fortnight previously, to
                    enable him to take a test of the patient's blood after the first operation.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> read the communication to Lili very
                    slowly, her voice trembling with excitement.</p>
                <p>"We will leave to-morrow morning, of course," said <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>.</p>
                <p>"Good; but in that case we must call on Doctor Karner to-day." Saying which,
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> hurried out of the room in order
                    to telephone to Dr. Karner's laboratory.</p>
                <p>When she returned a few minutes later with the news that Dr. Karner would not be
                    available for another hour, she found Lili standing in front of the window
                    holding Professor Kreutz' letter in her hand.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, we can start at once. We could walk
                    part of the distance. This will do you good."</p>
                <p>"No, no, not walk. I cannot yet show myself in the street." And her eyes filled
                    with tears.</p>
                <p>On the way <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> mentioned quite
                    incidentally that the Doctor's assistant, to whom she had</p>
                <pb n="145"/>
                <p><num style="page">146</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>telephoned, had not understood her name. "It was, indeed, somewhat difficult to
                    make it clear to her."</p>
                <p>It so happened that their taxi and Dr. Karner's car arrived at the laboratory at
                    the same time.</p>
                <p>"Good day, Doctor," said <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, immediately
                    recognizing him and extending her hand.</p>
                <p>"Good day, madam," answered the Doctor, momentarily surprised, as if he were
                    trying to remember her name.</p>
                <p>Lili looked in front of her, then looked at <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>, and at last took courage to say: "I have come from
                    Professor Arn's nursing-home. I am Lili Sparre." It was the first time that she
                    had pronounced her name. She heard herself speaking. A feeling of shame
                    overwhelmed her. "Don't you recognize me, then, Doctor?"</p>
                <p>"But of course, madam, of course," answered Dr. Kamer, although it was obvious
                    from his tone that he had not the least suspicion of the identity of the person
                    standing before him.</p>
                <p>"I understand it is a question of taking a blood test," he continued nervously,
                    and conducted the two ladies through the entrance hall and then into a
                    waiting-room.</p>
                <p>"Yes, Doctor; but are you still unable to recognize me?"</p>
                <p>The Doctor only became more confused. "<persName key="sparreAn">Sparre</persName>
                    . . . <persName key="sparreAn">Sparre</persName>. . . of course the name sounds
                    familiar. <persName key="sparreAn">Mr. Sparre</persName> was here about a
                    fortnight ago. He too was sent to me by <persName key="arns">Professor
                        Arns</persName>. But I cannot call you to mind, madam."</p>
                <p>"The gentleman and I, Doctor, are, in fact, one and the same person," stammered
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>.</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">147</num></p>
                <p>"I beg your pardon." Completely dumbfounded, Dr. Karner looked from one lady to
                    the otherâ€”then looked at his watch, and made a quick bow. "Oh, excuse me a
                    momentâ€”the ladies are foreigners, of course." And he bounded out of the
                    waiting-room.</p>
                <p>Beside herself with confusion, Lili looked at <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>. "I think I shall lose my reason."</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> laughed. "Your doctor is certainly of
                    your opinion. He did not understand a single word of what you told him."</p>
                <p>Suddenly Lili began to laugh. "But that is splendid. He too, then, did not
                    recognize me."</p>
                <p>A nurse came into the room and requested Lili to follow her. The Doctor was
                    waiting for her in the laboratory, which Lili immediately recognized. He was
                    holding a small instrument, similar to a morphia syringe, a transparent glass
                    syringe. He smiled, still somewhat embarrassed. "Please, madam."</p>
                <p>She heard the title ringing in her ears . . . madam.</p>
                <p>"Please, madam, will you sit down, and turn up your sleeve above the elbow, so
                    that I can get at the veins. So. . . . Much obliged, madam." </p>
                <p>With a distinctness never before experienced, Lili caught every word he uttered.
                    It seemed to her as if the words were floating in the room. Her eyes gazed
                    steadfastly at the syringe, whose needle was boring cautiously into her arm; she
                    saw the glass container slowly filling with her blood, and she fainted.</p>
                <p>When she came to herself, she looked around timidly.</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>The doctor was standing by the patient's chair with a smile on his face.</p>
                <p>"Have I been lying here long, Doctor?"</p>
                <p>"Only a few minutes. Did it hurt as much as all that?"</p>
                <p>"Hurt? Oh, no. You must not think that I am usually so bothersome."</p>
                <p>"Of course. <persName key="sparreAn">Mr. Sparre</persName> was not either.
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Sparre</persName>; if I understood aright, madam,
                    your husband . . ." </p>
                <p>"Mine? Yes, yes." She was so confused that she did not know where to look.</p>
                <p>Then the Doctor laughed. "So I did understand you correctly before. The German
                    language is a very difficult language. What you said before sounded very
                    amusingâ€”as if you had said that you and your husband were one and the same
                    person. Ha, ha, ha!"</p>
                <p>"But, Doctorâ€”"</p>
                <p>"Believe me, madam, even a German utters the most incredible stupidities when he
                    tries to make himself understood in a foreign language. However, to go back to
                    your husbandâ€”a stoic of a man, if you like. Now I remember, of courseâ€”although
                    he looked ill and exhausted when he sat before me in the same chair that you are
                    now occupyingâ€”he said not a word about his sufferings, declined even to hint at
                    them. Instead of this we conversed in the way usual among men here, especially
                    when one comes from abroad, that is to say, about politics, while I was tapping
                    his blood. Of course, I know very well that this cannot be done without hurting,
                    although your husband behaved as ifâ€”and really with successâ€”while you, madam . .
                    ."</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">149</num></p>
                <p>"Please, Doctor."</p>
                <p>"But, madam, that is your vested privilege, as a representative of the weaker
                    sex, while your husband is, if I may so express myself as a doctor, a prototype
                    of the <hi rend="italic">masculini generis</hi>. . . . "</p>
                <p>"My dear Doctor"â€”Lili now broke into a ringing laugh; she had risen and was
                    staring at him almost insolentlyâ€”"if you only knew what a lesson you had read me
                    with those words!"</p>
                <p>"Lesson?" The Doctor chivalrously leaned over her. "But I have nothing but
                    admiration for you, madam. You allowed the same blood test to be taken unbidden,
                    in the same way as your husbandâ€”which, moreover, was very sensible. Only women
                    can really do such things. A pain shared is a pain halved. Have I not come well
                    out of the business?"</p>
                <p>"Splendidly, Doctor. And now, good-bye." </p>
                <p>"Good-bye; and my kindest regards to your husband."</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, dearest," said <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, when they were again in the open air
                    together, "I have now got to the point of accepting with calm amusement the
                    comic side of such a situation as I have just been in, without the flicker of an
                    eyelash. If I did not do so, I should either go mad or lose myself."</p>
                <p>In the evening <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> wrote in her diary:</p>
                <p>"Lili is still trying to find her feet. People do not make it easier for her. By
                    people, I mean the former acquaintances of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>."</p>
                <p>"Come," said <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, "now I will take my first
                    walk through Berlin."</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>So they both went from Dr. Karner's laboratory through the bustle of the great
                    city, jostling strange people. It was a fine spring day. The sky was cloudless
                    and softly blue. The air felt like a prolonged caress. The faces of the people
                    they met, Lili noted with gay excitement, had such shining eyes. "Do I look like
                    that, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>?" she asked many times. And as
                    they strolled arm in arm they often stopped in front of shop windows. She never
                    grew weary of gazing at their display of silks, and she saw her reflection in
                    every plate-glass window. "<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, tell me,
                    do I look all right in my furs? Do I look any different from you?" And <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> smiled on her. "Child, remember your Dr.
                    Karnerâ€”and be glad that we have progressed so far as this."</p>
                <p>Lili desisted from her questions, but every now and then her eyes would dart a
                    glance of inquiry. Questions innumerable were stirring in her breast; but she
                    refrained from uttering them. She forced herself to show a smiling face, and
                    whispered to herself again and again: "Nobody knows me and my fate here in the
                    great city. Nobody mistrusts me. Nobody. I can carry my secret about with me in
                    peace. Nobody is betraying me. And it is a bright day with plenty of
                    sunshine."</p>
                <p>Really tired, she clung to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s arm.
                        "<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>," she said at once, "<persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, you are not ashamed of me?"</p>
                <p>When <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> regarded her with surprise,
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> behaved as if something had flown
                    in her eye.</p>
                <p>"But what's the matter?"</p>
                <p>"Nothing, nothing; we go to Dresden tomorrow, and I am glad Niels is going with
                    us. Sometimes I feel so afraid. I don't know why."</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">151</num></p>
                <p>This feeling of dread became so alarming during the last night before the
                    departure for Dresden that <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was
                    obliged to summon the assistance of the head nurse.</p>
                <p>Lili wept and wept through many despairing hours. "I cannot . . .I cannot. . .
                    .How can I look Professor Kreutz in the face? He doesn't know me. He doesn't
                    know who I am. I am afraid. I would rather die first." When at length she could
                    weep no more, she lay in her bed, staring in front of her.</p>
                <p>A thousand apprehensions assailed her. The railway journey to Dresden, all among
                    strange people . . . the arrival in another great city . . . the way to the
                    clinic . . . more strange people, with curious eyes . . . and then the
                    Professor. How would he receive her?</p>
                <p>Lili did not know herself what was going on within her.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had long since packed the trunks, had
                    found time for many cheery words, had talked about indifferent things, while
                    Lili was lying totally unconcerned.</p>
                <p>"And to-morrow I shall be with Professor Kreutz, and nobody can help meâ€”nobody."
                    She kept saying these words in a whisper. And when <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> told her that she and Professor Kreutz had only a single
                    thought, which was to help her, and that it was ungrateful to despond just now,
                    Lili only shook her head in a tired way. "<persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>, I know better. Nobody can help me. It is much too hard
                    for a tired soul."</p>
                <p>In the morning, when <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was still
                    sleepingâ€”she had not dropped off until very lateâ€”Lili</p>

                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, towards the not very large
                    mirror which <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had brought with her and
                    hung over the night table, converted into a dressing-table. She was not pleased
                    with what she saw. Ugly and inexpressive the reflection appeared to herâ€”a dull,
                    tired, anÃ¦mic mask. She sat down on a trunk and buried her face in her
                    hands.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>!" <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s arms were
                    round Lili's neck. "Now you look like a mother anxious for her child."</p>
                <p>"Anxious for her child?" Lili slowly repeated the words. "Yesâ€”for her ill-bred
                    child, as if such a mother could ever be cheerful."</p>
                <p>So the day started, and its hours crawled slowly by. Niels was an early
                    arrival.</p>
                <p>"Our Lili looks like an officer's miss," he cried, enthusiasticâ€”"haughty and
                    condescending! An incredible phenomenon."</p>
                <p>In half an hour the phenomenon will be on its way to its destination, <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName> reflected. The phenomenon. And she pulled
                    herself together. Nobody should see tears in her eyes to-day. Nobody. She must
                    empty her mind of all thought. Thus she was driven to the station, with eyes
                    which looked as if they saw. But they saw nothing. In the waiting-room she let
                    herself be persuaded to take breakfast with the others. She was obedient.
                    "To-day I will have no will of my own, Niels; to-day I will do what you both
                    order me."</p>
                <p>An abundant breakfast table was hastily improvised. "This spread," announced
                    Niels solemnly, "is to celebrate Lili's departure on her first overland
                    journey.</p>

                <p>The waiter had placed a pint tankard of Hofora in front of each. Niels raised his
                    tankard towards <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, and <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, the dainty, elegant <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, raised, not without considerable
                    difficulty, her tankard towards <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>â€”and
                    Lili was no spoil-sport.</p>
                <p>"Skaal, my dears," she said, "or prosit, as we must say here!" And before Niels
                    had clinked his tankard against Lili's, she had taken a generous draught.</p>
                <p>"Bravo, bravo!" cried Niels, so loudly that many of the people in the
                    waiting-room looked around them.</p>
                <p>Lili immediately put down her beaker. "Please, please don't excite attention."
                    She was stretched on the rack all the time.</p>
                <p>Yet she wanted to be gay. Moreover, as she honestly acknowledged, the fresh
                    aromatic beer had a glorious taste. And this refreshing breakfast with crusty
                    Berlin rolls and liver sausage and cheese, a real German morning mealâ€”did not in
                    the least resemble an invalid's diet.</p>
                <p>"It makes me feel quite a new being," she confessed. "It tastes like
                    resurrection. If only it gets to that point. Prosit! Long live life!"</p>
                <p>When it was time for the train to leave, <persName key="courtaud"
                    >Lili</persName>, clinging all the time to Niels' arm, pushed through the crowd
                    on the platform so quickly that <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had
                    difficulty in following them. A corner seat in a second-class compartment was
                    found for <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, while Niels and <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> secured seats opposite to her.</p>
                <p>With merry, wideawake eyes, which absorbed every trifle around her like a new
                    experience, Lili rode into her new life.</p>
                <p><num style="page">154</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>The landscape between Berlin and Dresden is a series of endless, monotonous
                    plains, thinly wooded, and here and there coloured red, white, and yellow by
                    small settlements, villages, townships and towns, broken only by occasional
                    placid brooks and streamsâ€”a picture devoid of excitement, a panorama calculated
                    to soothe and lull. Low overhead hung a blue-grey sky, while the fresh morning
                    wind drove golden clouds merrily before it like young lambs just released from
                    the fold. Then a large, bright green rectangle would swim into visionâ€”a winter
                    crop with the ears already sprouting, between silvering willow trees, while a
                    dark islet of cloud lowered spectral overhead. Sharply defined on the eastern
                    horizon was a church tower. Then the sun emerged from a heavy bank of cloud, and
                    flooded the whole world with a golden light. The telegraph wires buzzing up and
                    down in front of the carriage window. A flock of partridges ascending from a
                    dark patch of marshland and disappearing into a silvery birch wood. A
                    signalman's cottage with silver-birch trees and a few fruit trees, stunted and
                    cropped, and fluttering between them multi-coloured washing. A woman pressing
                    her hands on her hips, her eyes fixed on the train, beside her a fair child with
                    a glaring red ball in her hand, and a brown Pomeranian dog squatting beside the
                    child. Shooâ€”past! The woman's expression was plainly visible. A piece of blue-
                    and-white washing was waving like a flag in her right hand. An unpaved country
                    road curving towards the railway embankment. Two heavy farm-horses drawing a
                    heavily laden cart. The driver lashing out with the whip. The sun gilding</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">155</num></p>
                <p>him and the whipcord and the tin lid of his bowl-pipe, lighting up even the
                    puddles in the deep ruts of the cart-track. Behind a far-flung ridge tower
                    factory chimneys, and white and greenish-yellow smoke-plumes wind into the blue
                    until a breeze breaks them up and they become golden clouds.</p>
                <p>Lili's eyes had become the eyes of a painter, and a tremor passed through her.
                    "Those are not my eyes. They are <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>'
                    eyes. Is he not yet dead within me? Can he give me no peace, then?"</p>
                <p>She closed her eyes. She could not understand why she was so afraid to look at,
                    to grasp and to love the world, as <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>
                    had done. Was it because she feared she would never get on to her own feet,
                    never be loosened fromâ€”Andreas?</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and Niels had gone into the corridor
                    in order to smoke.</p>
                <p>In the compartment there remained two German gentlemen of very correct
                    appearance. The two corner seats by the door belonged to them.</p>
                <p>Up till then Lili had scarcely noticed her fellow-travellers. She had kept
                    herself entrenched behind newspapers.</p>
                <p>Suddenly one of the gentlemen laid his paper down and the other gentleman
                    followed suit, except that he almost solemnly folded up his newspaper.
                    Involuntarily she looked at him, and he returned her look very deliberately.
                    "Hm!" he grunted at least four times. The other gentleman flicked off some dust,
                    and removed his light-brown, very solid gloves. A thick diamond ring came to
                    light. He cleared his throat again. Lili drew her furs closer about her. She
                    felt the look of the two "lords</p>
                <p><num style="page">156</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>of creation" fixed upon her. She put on a very haughty expression.</p>
                <p>"Ahem," said the gentleman next to her. "Do you mind, madam?" She nodded her
                    assent.</p>
                <p>He offered her a heavy cigarette-case, inlaid with gold: "It is, to be sure, a
                    non-smoker; but both the other peopleâ€”ahem."</p>
                <p>Lili smiled: "No, thanks."</p>
                <p>"Hm!" And the gentleman shut his case with a snap and deliberately put it away in
                    his pocket.</p>
                <p>The gentleman opposite unfolded his newspaper.</p>
                <p>And Lili looked out of the window.</p>
                <p>A little dainty birch wood upon a hill under the sun. Two diminutive
                    mother-o'-pearl clouds overhead, like wings which a child angel had forgotten in
                    play.</p>
                <p>Niels had returned, and was again sitting in his corner seat.</p>
                <p>"Early spring," he said; "early spring, <persName key="courtaud"
                    >Lili</persName>."</p>
                <p>And <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, who also returned at this moment,
                    repeated the word, "Early spring. . . . I never heard the word VorfrÃ¼hling
                    before. A beautiful word. Oh to be out there painting as I used to! . . ."</p>
                <p>Then she broke off, avoided Lili's look, and closed her eyes.</p>
                <p>For a whole hour they sat thus silent.</p>
                <p>In Lili's ears <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s words still echoed:
                    "Early spring . . . painting as I used to," and she completed the sentence,
                    "with <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>."</p>
                <p>Was it jealousy which was now stirring in her?</p>
                <p>No, no; the idea was impossible.</p>
                <p>She leaned across to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>â€”no one saw it,
                    not</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">157</num></p>
                <p>even Niels, who had fallen asleep like <persName key="sparreGre"
                    >Grete</persName>, while the two strange gentlemen were standing outside in the
                    corridor smokingâ€”and laid her hand in <persName key="sparreGre"
                    >Grete</persName>'s lap. Then she rose and sat next to <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>, laid her head against <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>'s shoulder and gazed out of the window again. Ranges of
                    hills were billowing up, growing into small mountains, and new ones kept joining
                    them, dotted with villas. And eventually everything became a confusion of villas
                    and gardens and tenement housesâ€”between which factory buildings reared their
                    heads and streets opened like canals between columns of houses, while the
                    columns of houses became great settlements full of pulsating life. Trams, cars,
                    people, clamouring advertisements on blank walls, a wide ramification of railway
                    lines on either side, trains with an endless line of coaches, a station on the
                    right hand and the left hand, a continuous shuddering of the carriage as it slid
                    rumblingly past the points.</p>
                <p>Then the train stopped.</p>
                <p>Niels woke up.</p>
                <p>"Shall we soon be there?" asked <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>.</p>
                <p>"The next station." She awoke <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>.</p>
                <p>When the train started again, all three of them were standing at the window. Now
                    they were crossing the long bridge, under which the broad, dark river extended
                    like a glistening velvet ribbon, and Lili saw Dresden's domes and towers and
                    roofs emerge from the shimmering water-surface. Slowly she looked up and saw
                    that it was no phantasmagoriaâ€”this magnificent city on both banks of the River
                    Elbe, ascending from the broad valley to green hills and the soft blue sky.</p>
                <p><num style="page">158</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>She knelt on her seat and stared out and drank in the picture of this place of
                    pilgrimage, longed for so ardently and vouchsafed her in return for so much
                    suffering. And her eyes became too full and too heavy. She closed them, and
                    pressed her hands against her heart. The tears she wept were the soft tears of
                    faith. A feeling of boundless happiness flooded her whole being. "Now I am home
                    . . . now I shall soon be home."</p>
                <p>Niels laid his hand on her shoulder. "Child, child."</p>
                <p>"It is only for happiness, Niels."</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was standing beside her. She could
                    find no word to utter, but many tears to shed.</p>
                <p>How Lili got out of the compartment, how she made her entry into Dresden in a
                    taxi-cab, she could never afterwards remember.</p>
                <p>It was a long drive. Soon the streets of the city lay behind them, and they were
                    traversing the residential districts. They passed a block of tall buildings,
                    then suddenly the cab turned round a corner. Slender, white, gleaming birch
                    trees raised their filagree-fine branches above a garden wall, behind which
                    towered a grey, solemn, massive block of buildings, comprised of many
                    houses.</p>
                <p>"Stop, stop!" cried <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. "Here we are!"</p>
                <p>The next moment the cab stopped in front of a porch, which bore in large letters
                    the inscription:</p>
                <p>"MUNICIPAL WOMEN'S CLINIC."</p>
                <p>"How could you know that?" asked <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and
                    Niels, as they were helping Lili to alight.</p>
                <p>"I felt that it must be here," answered Lili</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">159</num></p>
                <p>very faintly. "Help me a little, so that I can walk. It was such a long,
                    fatiguing journey."</p>
                <p>When they stood in front of the porch and rang the bell Lili was pale as death.
                    She heard the pealing of the hospital bell, and it seemed to her as if she was
                    hearing the sound of her own heart.</p>
                <p>A white-clad nurse hailed them from the window of the porter's lodge. "Private
                    patients' ward? Straight through the garden, please." By this time it was late
                    afternoon. A soft, subdued light from a watery sky flooded the large garden.
                    Lili led the way. She was home at last.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter" n="12">
                <p><num style="chapter">XII</num></p>
                <p>Standing at the entrance door to the private clinic was an elderly white-clad
                    nurse, who was embracing a lady. This was Lili's first impression of the Women's
                    Clinic, and this impression remained.</p>
                <p>The elderly nurse was <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName>. She was
                    bidding farewell to a patient.</p>
                <p>Then she received the three foreigners with great cordiality, and ushered them
                    into a long hospital corridor. Twilight had already set in, and through the
                    glass panes of a large folding-door at the end of the corridor fell a soft
                    sea-green shimmer, which was reflected on the polished floor and the many
                    white-lacquered doors.</p>
                <p>"The Professor will be with you in a moment," said <persName key="matron">the
                        Matron</persName>.</p>
                <p>Near the large folding-door were a few armchairs and a small table, illuminated
                    by a lamp, where a doctor in a white smock was conversing with two ladies.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> seized Lili's hand. "That's Professor
                    Kreutz," she whispered.</p>
                <p>"You are mistaken, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>," said Niels.
                    "Besides, you have never seen him. Surely he is only an assistant doctor."</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> is right. It is Professor Kreutz,"
                    whispered Lili with a trembling voice.</p>

                <p>While he was conducting the two ladies to the office, he remained standing a
                    moment and greeted the newcomers with ceremonious politeness, after which he
                    requested them to sit down.</p>
                <p>They all seated themselves about the round table. Lili had relapsed into silence.
                    White-clad nurses came and went and said good day. But Lili had eyes and ears
                    for nothing.</p>
                <p>Only when the door of the office opened again and the two ladies were ushered out
                    by the Professor, did she become wide awake.</p>
                <p><persName key="matron">The Matron</persName> made a sign to them, and Niels took
                    Lili's hand. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> remained sitting in the
                    armchair.</p>
                <p>Two months before Professor Kreutz had seen <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> in Paris on a single occasion. Now Lili stood in front
                    of him for the first time. The Professor led her into the office, and then went
                    out again to welcome <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>.</p>
                <p><persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, who had suddenly become very calm,
                    looked about her in the room. It was a large apartment and might have been a
                    study or an operating-room. In front of the large window, which gave a view of
                    the birch trees in the garden, stood a chair for patients, and in front of one
                    wall was a writing-desk, full of papers. Everything in the room was dazzling
                    white.</p>
                <p>When the Professor returned, he sat down opposite <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>. She began to chat about her stay in Berlin. Suddenly he
                    interrupted her with a question. His rather stern face broke into a smile.</p>
                <p>"Did <persName key="arns">Professor Arns</persName> acquaint you with the result
                    of his chemical and miscroscopical examination?</p>
                <p>"No, Professor."</p>
                <p>"Well, then, I can tell you the welcome news</p>
                <p><num style="page">162</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>that all the examinations gave the most favourable results. Everything confirms
                    our assumption."</p>
                <p>She breathed again. She was relieved of the necessity of explanations.</p>
                <p>She listened to his peculiar velvety voice. A feeling of happiness stole over
                    her. The Professor spoke so sympathetically about everything that affected her
                    that she grew courageous, and suddenly began to relate her experience with Dr.
                    Karner in Berlin. But when she looked up she gazed into Professor Kreutz' eyes,
                    those eyes that were light and dark at the same time, and her words died on her
                    lips. She could not utter another syllable. It flashed upon her that <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had been able to talk quite freely to the
                    Professor in Paris. Why could she not do so?</p>
                <p>Professor Kreutz regarded her inquiringly, and waited for her to proceed with her
                    story. When, however, she failed to do so, he broke the silence.</p>
                <p>"I really intended you to come into the private ward immediately, but, in a most
                    unexpected fashion, every bed is at the moment occupied. This is, perhaps, just
                    as well, as we must wait a little before the operation is performed. I am
                    looking out for a pair of particularly good glands for you."</p>
                <p>At this realistic argument Lili shuddered. She did not know where to turn her
                    eyes. She was overwhelmed with shame, and utterly embarrassed.</p>
                <p>The Professor seemed hardly to notice this, for he continued calmly:</p>
                <p>"Besides, it will do you nothing but good to spend a few days in the hotel, and
                    see the town and our museum. Moreover, you could do some painting. You will find
                    plenty of subjects here. Such a distraction should be most beneficial to
                    you."</p>

                <p><num style="page">163</num></p>
                <p>At these words Lili seemed to lose all her moral support. The idea of not being
                    immediately received into the clinic, but stopping for days in a strange hotel,
                    appeared to her as monstrous as an undeserved punishment. She wanted to beg the
                    Professor to be allowed to remain there, she wanted to rebel against his
                    decision. She looked imploringly at the Professor, but could find nothing to say
                    except:</p>
                <p>"Very well, Professor."</p>
                <p>This ended the interview. The Professor held out his hand, and went out of the
                    room with her to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. He mentioned an
                    hotel in the vicinity of the Women's Clinic and bade her good-bye very
                    formally.</p>
                <p>Utterly disconcerted, Lili met <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. She
                    felt as if she had suffered a disastrous defeat. A single glance of this man had
                    deprived her of all her strength. She felt as if her whole personality had been
                    crushed by him. With a single glance he had extinguished it. Something within
                    her rebelled. She felt like a schoolgirl who had received short shrift from an
                    idolized teacher. She heard the Professor's voice ringing in her ear. She was
                    conscious of a peculiar weakness in all her members. She stood there as if in a
                    fog and apprehended nothing. But later, when she recalled this moment, she found
                    an explanation: it was the first time her woman's heart had trembled before her
                    lord and master, before the man who had constituted himself her protector, and
                    she understood why she then submitted so utterly to him and his will.</p>
                <p>The hotel which Professor Kreutz had recommended to them was situated in a wide
                    square</p>
                <p><num style="page">164</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>surrounded by trees, and had a garden. It was a quiet, select establishment, and
                    was scarcely ten minutes' distance from the Women's Clinic.</p>
                <p>A large light room which overlooked the square was assigned to Lili and <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. Niels installed himself in another room.
                    They were heavy, oppressive days which Lili had now to endure. She could not
                    understand why she could not be immediately received into the clinic. She was
                    almost convinced that Professor Kreutz found her unsympathetic and that she had
                    a repellent effect upon him.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> wrote down in her diary:</p>
                <p>"Lili is utterly despondent. She thinks the Professor sees in her nothing but a
                    female impersonator, that is to say, <persName key="sparreAn"
                    >Andreas</persName>. She imagines that she has an ugly and disagreeable
                    appearance, and that every normal person must be repelled by her. She weeps
                    perpetually. We have gone out on a number of occasions, but, dominated by her
                    fixed idea, Lili thought she could read in every glance of the passers-by a
                    confirmation of Professor Kreutz's aversion. It goes without saying that we
                    foreigners should attract attention here in Dresden, but she blames herself
                    entirely. She is indignant because the Professor suggested that she should do
                    some painting in the interval. That was the worst thing he could have said.
                    Everything that relates to <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> is
                    detested by her, but especially painting."</p>
                <p>In order to break right away from <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>,
                    she must, above all, avoid practising his most characteristic activity. "The
                    Professor ought to</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">165</num></p>
                <p>have known this," said <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, "or else he
                    intended to convey that he saw in <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>
                    nothing but an impersonation of <persName key="sparreAn"
                    >Andreas</persName>."</p>
                <p>The following day <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> wrote in her
                    diary:</p>
                <p>"Niels was certainly quite right when he said that what the Professor is now
                    doing with Lili is nothing less than an emotional moulding, which is preceding
                    the physical moulding into a woman. Hitherto Lili has been like clay which
                    others had prepared and to which the Professor has given form and life by a
                    transient touch. Up till now, he thought, Lili's femininity has been only
                    superficial, not yet completely wholly genuine. By a single glance the Professor
                    yesterday awoke her heart to life, to a life with all the instincts of woman.
                    The more I ponder over this, the more heartily I agree with Niels. Lili is now
                    silent and completely wrapped up in herself. True, she still weeps softly to
                    herself at times; but those are the tears of nostalgia. She does not know
                    herself what is happening to her, and I can do nothing more than assist her with
                    encouraging words and patience."</p>
                <p>The next page contained the following entry:</p>
                <p>"Lili said to me last night: 'It is certainly unjust of me to think bitterly of
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, but sometimes I am obliged to
                    think of him, and then I do not quite know what to call him. I think I must call
                    him my dead brother, and to this I must get accustomed. So much so that I cannot
                    any longer realize that he and I have dwelt in the same body and this this body
                    now</p>
                <p><num style="page">166</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>belongs to me alone.' Then she said: 'Perhaps I am the murderer of <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, and this idea tortures me fearfully, as I
                    surmise that I shall perhaps be of much less value than he. He was a creative
                    person. He was a painter, with a long record behind him. And just because of
                    this I am afraid of wanting to achieve anything. For if I should really once
                    paint and then perceive that my performance fell below his, this would
                    completely upset me, and I would commit suicide!' Suddenly she said: '<persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, I see in front of me the clothes of
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> which we left behind in Berlin.
                    I see every article of clothing. And I think of them at night. And I am afraid
                    to go to sleep again, lest I should dream that I was slipping these clothes
                    on."'</p>
                <p>Thus a whole week passed. A deep melancholy hung over <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>, and this melancholy deepened into an icy horror when one
                    morning a number of letters from Copenhagen, addressed to <persName>Monsieur
                            <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName> of
                            <placeName>Paris</placeName></persName>, arrived from the Women's
                    Clinic. She would not even touch the letters. Even <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> was not allowed to read the letters. Niels had to burn
                    them. And now Lili was convinced that she would never be able to enter the
                    Women's Clinic.</p>
                <p>"The letters have made it impossible. Let us disappear from here," implored
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> without tears, firmly resolved to
                    efface herself in silence. Then, like a release, came news from the Women's
                    Clinic that a room was now free for <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>,
                    and <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> went with her the short distance
                    to the hospital.</p>
                <p>The next day Niels returned to Berlin.</p>

                <p>Many times Lili tried to recall the first moments she spent in the Women's
                    Clinic, and every time she felt again the infinite peace which had then settled
                    upon her distracted spirit. A ray of hope, which, like a Bachian hymn, was
                    carried by angel voices to an invisible vault.</p>
                <p>All anxiety and unrest fell away from her. Her own life appeared to her of
                    secondary importance, and so valueless. An obscure feeling inspired her with
                    devotion, a feeling of participating in something new and great, something that
                    transcended everything that came within the range of ordinary experience. A
                    white sickroom, brightened by the green reflection from the garden. A white bed.
                    Upon a white table mysterious shining instruments and forceps under a glass
                    case. An odour of ether and formalin over everything. Visits from <persName
                        key="matron">the Matron</persName>, a well-preserved motherly woman in white
                    nurse's uniform with starched white cap on her silver-grey hair. Now and again,
                    penetrating through the folding-door a muffled noise, gradually dying downâ€”the
                    sound of invalid carriages rolling past. And in the white room <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. Now and then soft voices and footfalls.
                    The door is opened, a slender figure in a white coat enters, and remains
                    standing in the room.</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>only an almost musical recollection. A voice. A vision. What he said to her faded
                    right out of her mind. But from the moment he stood before her in the white
                    sick-room, all her burdens slipped away. And her whole being was flooded with
                    assurance and joyous hope.</p>
                <p>Lili went out under the birch trees in the large garden and waited. The Professor
                    had told her that everything would be ready for the operation within a day or
                    two.</p>
                <p>The white trees gleamed silvery upon the shining green borders. Their branches
                    stood out against the grey, quivering atmosphere as if bathed in a reddish
                    sheen. Here and there hedges and bushes with their branches still bare. Silky
                    catkins on the few willow trees, and here and there yellow buds. And many seats
                    along the paths. White-clad sisters resting after lunch greeted Lili and
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. And in the middle of the large
                    garden a bevy of young, pregnant women. They were laughing joyously and happily,
                    and in their blue hospital clothes looked like big crocuses just sprung up.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>," said <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>, "now I understand the beautiful German word
                    'fore-spring'. Everything here is so full of expectation."</p>
                <p>Then a slender man in white overalls hastened across the park to the septic
                    station. An assistant doctor followed him, and a whisper flew from mouth to
                    mouth: "The Professor." All eyes were riveted on him, and everything seemed to
                    stop for a moment.</p>
                <p>And then the turret clock of the clinic struck. Six o'clock. It was time to
                    return to one's room. The park was already dark. Arm in arm Lili and</p>

                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> went slowly into the large house. The
                    lights were burning in the broad, white corridors. Young nurses in white
                    uniforms, with white, tight-fitting caps, were bringing the patients' evening
                    meal. Down below, in front of the Professor's room, stood <persName key="matron"
                        >the Matron</persName>. Suddenly his voice sounded through the open door,
                    and Lili shuddered. In a fright she drew <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> with her round the corner into the corridor whereon her
                    room was situated.</p>
                <p>"What's the matter?" asked <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>.</p>
                <p>"Hurry," whispered <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, breathless, and
                    slipped into her room. An inexplicable fear had gripped her at the sound of the
                    Professor's voice. Once again she felt like a schoolgirl! The next evening, when
                    Lili was put to bed, she was subjected to all the ceremonies that precede an
                    operation. And <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> sat beside her to
                    offer encouragement. The Professor had already intimated in the morning that if
                    a young woman who had to be operated upon the following day possessed suitable
                    ovaries, the transplantation should be effected forthwith. Excited and happy she
                    bade <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> farewell this evening. She lay
                    awake for hours and stared into the white room. The night-lamp diffused a
                    subdued light. Nurse Hannah, young and pretty, sat beside her, conversed with
                    her, placed a sleeping-draught on the night table, and then softly
                    disappeared.</p>
                <p>Lili did not take the sleeping-draught. She was afraid of sleeping too long. She
                    wanted to be wide awake when next morning, her great morning, came.</p>
                <p>Not another sound was heard from the corridors. Everything was drowned in the
                    silence of the night. Lili's thoughts were suffused with gentle light.</p>
                <p><num style="page">170</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>It seemed to her as if she no longer had any responsibility for herself, for her
                    fate. For Werner Kreutz had relieved her of it all. Nor had she any longer a
                    will of her own.</p>
                <p>And suddenly she thought of the past, of Paris. Yet the next moment she fled from
                    this recollection. There could be no past for her. Everything in the past
                    belonged to a person who had vanished, who was dead. How altogether different
                    from her <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName> had been! Now there
                    was only a perfectly humble woman, who was ready to obey, who was happy to
                    submit herself to the will of another.</p>
                <p>The turret clock chimed again. She heard it many times that night.</p>
                <p>When the first streaks of dawn came stealing through the curtains, Lili was
                    already wide awake. It was six o'clock, and at seven o'clock sister Hannah came
                    in and prepared her for the operation. Then there was a long, tedious wait,
                    during which she hardly dared to move. She strained her ears for every step in
                    the corridor, every sound that penetrated thence, and every noise; but nobody
                    stopped outside her door. Had they forgotten her?</p>
                <p>At length <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName> came into the room and
                    conveyed to her the doleful news that she must wait yet a few days longer, as
                    the invalid in question who had been operated upon had "yielded no suitable
                    material" for <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>.</p>
                <p>Disappointment and suspense would have brought her to the verge of tears if
                        <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName> had not informed her at the
                    same time that she was to be allotted a new room which had a large window
                    overlooking the garden and a sunny aspect.</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">171</num></p>
                <p>And when <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> arrived a few minutes later
                    the removal to the new room was immediately begun.</p>
                <p>Again they strolled arm in arm through the park of the Women's Clinic. How
                    quickly everything here had become familiar to them, even the white-clad nurses,
                    whose morning greetings they gratefully acknowledged! And Lili smiled happily on
                    the young pregnant women in the crocus costumes. Now and then young doctors
                    passed, and they too wished her: "Good morning, madam."</p>
                <p>Lili was happy. Here she was walking quite naturally like a young woman among
                    other young women. She was a creature without any past. Had she ever looked any
                    different from now? She smiled. Then suddenly she saw <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> in her mind's eye, how he had regarded charming and
                    elegantly dressed women in Paris, and had almost envied them their elegance. How
                    dull and insipid, he had often said, was male attire! Now all this was past and
                    overâ€”obliterated as if by a gesture of her master, her creator, her Professor.
                    There was no longer an <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>; he could
                    never return. Now between him and her stood Werner Kreutz. She felt secure and
                    salvaged.</p>
                <p>Here in this little state within a state men ruled with absolute power, with the
                    Professor at their head. <persName key="matron">The Matron</persName> was the
                    single exception. In spite of her maternal benevolence, she was a very decisive
                    lady, whose energetic profile under the silver-grey hair might recall <persName
                        key="bourbons">the Bourbons</persName> in their splendid period. Her
                    personality compelled respectâ€”she was the only person in the Women's Clinic who
                    enjoyed, to a certain extent, the confidence of Werner Kreutz.</p>
                <p><num style="page">172</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>One morning she intercepted Lili and told her that it would certainly not last
                    much longer. Perhaps to-morrow, perhaps the day after tomorrow, the operation
                    could be performed.</p>
                <p>"Tell me, <persName key="matron">Matron</persName>," asked Lili abruptly, "why
                    are really healthy ovaries removed from a woman?" </p>
                <p>"But, Miss <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>," answered <persName
                        key="matron">the Matron</persName>, "it would take too long to explain this
                    to you, especially as you do not possess the necessary anatomical knowledge to
                    understand it. But be easy in your mind, the Professor knows what he is doing.
                    Leave everything to him. Moreover, you need not have any fear, as your operation
                    will be quite a minor one."</p>
                <p>Lili laughed.</p>
                <p>"I have no fear at all, <persName key="matron">Matron</persName>. In Berlin I was
                    also told that it was only quite a minor operation which was to be performed.
                    And subsequently I learned that I was nearly an hour and a half on the
                    operating-table. Whether this new operation is dangerous or harmless does not
                    bother me in the least. I have not come here to die. Of that I feel certain. I
                    could have done this without the help of the Professor."</p>
                <p><persName key="matron">The Matron</persName> drew Lili close to her. "You will be
                    very pleased to know, Miss <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, that the
                    new ovaries which the Professor proposes to ingraft upon you will give you new
                    vitality and new youth. The woman who is to be operated upon is, in fact,
                    scarcely twenty-seven years old."</p>
                <p>Lili's voice trembled with excitement. "Is it really true, <persName key="matron"
                        >Matron</persName>, that the age of a womanis determined by her ovaries? Is
                    that really the decisive factor for a woman?"<pb/>MAN INTO WOMAN 173</p>
                <p><persName key="matron">The Matron</persName> patted <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>. "How curious you are! But if you don't believe me, you can
                    ask our Professor."</p>
                <p>"Yes, of course. Why have I not done so long ago? I will ask him this very
                    evening."</p>
                <p>But when <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName> asked on the following
                    morning whether the Professor had satisfied her curiosity, Lili felt very
                    ashamed. "No," she said; "I forgot all about it."</p>
                <p><persName key="matron">The Matron</persName> lifted her forefinger and laughingly
                    threatened: "Why not say quite honestly that you did not dare to do so!"</p>
                <p>"No, I did not dare to do so," confessed <persName key="courtaud"
                    >Lili</persName>. </p>
                <p>"It needn't make you blush, my dear Miss <persName key="courtaud"
                    >Lili</persName>. Why should you be any different from the other women in the
                    hospital?"</p>
                <p>Two days later <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> filled many pages of
                    her diary. This was the day on which the great operation was performed on
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. And the night was far advanced
                    when <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> wrote:</p>
                <p>"At nine o'clock this morning I arrived at the clinic. The Professor had told me
                    yesterday evening that the operation was to take place today. Cautiously I
                    peered into Lili's room. Lili lay in a white night-dress in her white bed. She
                    was quietly sleeping. She had been given a morphia injection. I cautiously
                    retired to the long corridor, where nurses were waiting for the Professor. Nurse
                    Margaret came out of the board-room, wheeling a table on castors, with ether
                    bottles, cotton-wool, and instruments under glass cases. <persName key="matron"
                        >The Matron</persName> appeared and cast a searching eye over everything:
                    The head doctor</p>
                <p><num style="page">174</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>and a number of young assistant doctors came out of the operating-theatre.
                    Everybody spoke softly. A strange stillness reigned in the broad, white
                    corridor. A greenish light drifted through the high window, through which could
                    be seen the still bare trees of the park, and, lit up by the morning sun, the
                    wing in which the Professor's quarters were situated. A covered gangway
                    connected the first storey with the main department of the clinic. Thence all
                    eyes were directed.</p>
                <p>"'Now we are still waiting for the Professor,' said a little nurse to me in a
                    whisper. I could scarcely control my agitation, and stared continuously out of
                    the window at the Professor's quarters.</p>
                <p>"Suddenly there was a movement among the nurses. Involuntarily I seized the
                    little nurse's hand. Everything around me was in commotion. I saw the Professor
                    approaching the clinic with rapid steps, and the next moment I heard him
                    greeting everybody with a polite, 'Good morning'. He was very ceremonious and
                    unapproachable, even towards me, although we had always been on very friendly
                    terms. I did not venture to address him, nor even to follow him, when, in
                    company with the head doctor and <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName>,
                    he disappeared into Lili's room. He resembled a general on the eve of a decisive
                    battle.</p>
                <p>"Minutes passed. I stood by the open door looking upon the garden. The morning
                    sunshine streamed in. I was no doubt very pale. The air was of spring-like
                    warmth. A few birds were singing in the trees. A golden haze hung over them, and
                    a soft wind blew in, smelling of grass</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">175</num></p>
                <p>and earth and mingling with the strange, all-penetrating hospital odour. Then the
                    door of Lili's room was opened a little, and a hand was put out. Sister Frieda,
                    who was standing in front of the door, hastily took a bottle of ether from the
                    movable table, handed it in, and the door noiselessly closed again. Soon the
                    sickly smell of ether escaped from the room and penetrated everywhere. I felt as
                    if I were going to faint; but I pulled myself together.</p>
                <p>"An endless time seemed to elapse, and then the door opened again. The Professor
                    and <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName> came out. The Professor took my
                    hand and looked into my eyes. 'Don't worry,' he said softly, and disappeared to
                    make further visits. The ambulance was pushed out of the door, followed by two
                    nurses. Underneath a white covering lay <persName key="courtaud"
                    >Lili</persName>. I could not recognize her face. . . it lay under the ether
                    mask. Then the white procession disappeared along the white corridor into the
                    operating-theatre. How long would it last? I kept saying to myself: Don't think,
                    don't think. What are they doing now to this poor creature? In what form will
                    Lili be returned to me? How cheerfully she looked forward to this moment? A
                    miracle was to be worked on her. Would it succeed?'</p>
                <p>"Restless, I wandered out into the garden, and strolled along all the paths of
                    the great park, but could find no peace. Went back to Lili's room. All the
                    windows were open. The spring sunshine was flooding the room. But I could not
                    stop there. Finally I sat down in an armchair in the corridor and waited. There
                    I was able</p>
                <p><num style="page">176</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>to see everything that was going on. It was so quiet. Now Lili was lying under
                    her Master's knife. No, I was not afraid. I believed in him, as Lili blindly
                    believed in him, as in a higher Power. And I thought of this man, whom I had
                    recently tried to paint.</p>
                <p>"And now I realized how all my powers had been bent upon an effort to retain this
                    masculine head in a portrait. What power radiated from this strange person? Here
                    in this Women's Clinic was a god, whom all feared, whom all revered. In what did
                    his power consist? And I recalled his face. Was it really handsome? No; strange,
                    rather. No feature of his face was really handsome. Everything, even the eyes,
                    were irregular. And yet a striking harmony characterized the whole, a force, an
                    emanation of force. For days I had tried to capture this face, to retain it in
                    many hasty sketches. I knew all his attitudes, all his movements. This armchair
                    had been my daily observation-post. Opposite his office. I knew precisely the
                    time he came and the time he went. His visiting times, and his promenades
                    through the rooms.</p>
                <p>"I closed my eyes in order to collect my thoughts. I saw distinctly the slender
                    back of the Professor in the long white overall. I saw him in my mind's eye, as
                    he would throw back his head with a sudden jerk. I saw him as he would advance
                    towards me, his hands outstretched and a stern smile playing about his lips.
                    Every time I had seen this smile I had felt as if I must weep. I had seen so
                    many menâ€” smiling, handsome men, important men, and </p>

                <p>others. This weeping, this fear, all this emotion had nothing to do with my
                    heart. I knew that. For I had never for a moment been in love with this man. And
                    yet how often had I cried myself to sleep, thinking of him! Yesterday, in the
                    centre of the town, among strange people, I had a vision of this smile. And it
                    flashed across me that I would gladly sacrifice my life for this man.</p>
                <p>"But why, whence came this feeling? And then I told myself that I was only one of
                    the many who believed in this man through the mere force of belief, who believed
                    in the helper in him through their belief in some kind of helper. As I now sat
                    here in the armchair in the white corridor I realized that my feeling for this
                    man was nothing less than the feeling which Lili cherished for him in the
                    deepest recesses of her heart. With her it is certainly still slumbering, for
                    she is as yet merely a vague being. <hi rend="italic">VorfrÃ¼hling</hi>: early
                    spring! This word suddenly sounded like music to my ears. Would Lili really see
                    it?</p>
                <p>"I was still sitting with closed eyes when suddenly the door of the operating
                    theatre was flung open and Werner Kreutz was standing in front of me . . . still
                    in the indiarubber apron. His gait was tired. He held out both his hands and
                    gave me a broad, benevolent smile. I only heard his words: 'Everything has
                    passed off well.' I clasped both his hands. And I could only stammer: 'I thank
                    you.'</p>
                <p>"Not until a few hours later did I learn what had happened inside. To find words
                    in which to put it is unspeakably difficult. A whole human</p>
                <p><num style="page">178</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>life which I shared with another floats before me as I write these words. A human
                    being who was born a man, who was my husband, my friend, my comradeâ€”has now
                    become a woman, a complete woman. And this human being was never intended to be
                    anything but a woman. Like a sacrificial animal he has been dragged along with
                    me for years until this German doctor brought him help! And to-day this human
                    being has laid here bleeding under the knife of his helper. His body was opened,
                    and disclosed a state of things which the craziest imagination would hardly have
                    considered possible. The body of this human being contained stunted and withered
                    ovaries which were not able to develop because an inscrutable Fate had also
                    given him the others, the male germ glands. This secret of existing as a double
                    being, hitherto divined by no doctor, has only been unveiled to-day, after
                    Werner Kreutz had guessed at its existence in Paris, and like a wizard
                    deciphered it.</p>
                <p>"I can find no other words with which to express my meaning. And now this poor
                    creature, so heavily handicapped by Fate, has had removed from its body what had
                    formed such an obstacle, thus enabling it now to develop as its blood had
                    dictated for years, namely, as a woman, and it has been equipped with unimpaired
                    female germ glands from another, a strange and quite young creature. Then this
                    tortured body was sewn up again, and now nothing more is left, not a particle is
                    left of my life's comrade and fellow-wayfarerâ€”Andreas. He is the dead brother of
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, who now lives, of the woman who
                    has<pb/>MAN INTO WOMAN 179</p>
                <p>shared flesh and blood with him for almost a lifetime.</p>
                <p>"But the thought which haunts me is that though <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> may now be extinguished, and though Lili may have risen
                    like a phoenix from the ashes, yet in the world outside <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> is still living in the eyes of the law, and I am his
                    wife. Who is capable of grasping this horror, this fantastic idea, this unique
                    happening? She whom it concerns most nearly, <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>, is still lying lulled in the mists of merciful
                    morphia.</p>
                <p>"What will life now bring her? Will the miracle of the doctor, the miracle of his
                    art, be great and strong enough to be perpetuated in Lili's life? All of us have
                    been instruments of this fate. I not least. For it was I who many years ago
                    enticed Lili out of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, in wanton play,
                    as a chance masquerade! And it was I who continued playing this game with
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, until what had been play became
                    earnest, most mysteriously earnest. But I must not think of this now; I cannot
                    help thinking of the one person who never really believed in <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, but only in <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>, Lili's most intimate friend, <persName key="lejeuneClaude"
                        >Claude Lejeune</persName>. What will he think when he sees her again?"</p>
                <p>There is very little that Lili can remember of this day, which henceforth she
                    called the day of her proper birth. When she opened her eyes for the first time,
                    she saw a few sunbeams stealing through a rift in the drawn window-curtains.
                    Then her eyes closed again and she slept long and heavily. When she awoke again,
                    it seemed as if</p>
                <p><num style="page">180</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>she had been dreaming. Here, to the left of her bed, in front of the window, she
                    had seen the silhouette of the Professor, and beside him the head doctor. The
                    Professor had asked something. Good! "Have you a good bite?"</p>
                <p>She had answered with a humble: "No, Professor," suppressing with difficulty a
                    smile.</p>
                <p>And then the Professor had ordered: "Count. Either in Danish or French, just as
                    you like."</p>
                <p>She had started counting in German: "One, two, three," when an ether mask had
                    been slipped over her face. She found it difficult to breathe. She went on
                    counting: "Four, five, six, seven." The counting became harder and slower. When
                    she came to eighteen, she felt as if she were suffocating. She heard the voice
                    of the Professor: "Twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two . . ."</p>
                <p>His voice sounded above her like the ticking of a clock, 'which grew louder and
                    louder, until everything became one continuous buzz and she lost consciousness.
                    Was it a dream?' Or had she been stupefied? But why had they left her lying here
                    so long without operating upon her? Until she had awakened with this unpleasant
                    ether taste in her mouth? "You haven't any bite?"</p>
                <p>She heard this question again. But the smile gave way to a terrible pain. With a
                    shriek she opened her eyes. <persName key="matron">The Matron</persName> was
                    standing beside here, smiling to her and whispering: "You've come through all
                    right. It went off splendidly. Now everything is going on well." But her eyes
                    had already closed again, and she was sleeping. When she was awakened again by
                    pains which became more and more acute, <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> was standing</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">181</num></p>
                <p>beside her with a bunch of red tulips. A nurse came in, gave her an injection,
                    and she went off to sleep again. Once the Professor stood beside her, held her
                    hand, and said something that she did not understand. But she saw his eyes, and
                    with a drowsy feeling sank into oblivion again.</p>
                <p>That day and the night which followed it were passed in the mists of morphia.
                    When she awoke, the pains were there, but a sister was also beside her with a
                    morphia syringe. She was conscious of acute thirst. Moist cotton-wool was laid
                    upon the parched mouth. But the injections of morphia caused even thirst to be
                    forgotten.</p>
                <p>Thus morning came. Everything had really passed off very well, and peaceful,
                    natural sleep soon enfolded her again. The following days stole by softly and
                    mistily. If she was attacked by pain, it was repelled by narcotics. If she
                    opened her eyes, she would stare in front of her as if astonished at everything
                    that had happened to her. Gradually she became accustomed even to the pain; she
                    told herself that these pains were the price to be paid for what had been
                    bestowed upon her, her own life, her woman's life. The prospect was fair and
                    hopeful. Her white room in the Women's Clinic seemed to her like an earthly
                    paradise. The Professor was the guardian of her paradise. Morning and evening he
                    stopped for a few moments by her bedside. Between these visits all was
                    expectation.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was always at hand during these days.
                    From the door leading to the garden she painted the white birch trees and the
                    garden paths. If she saw the Professor coming, she would hurry back to <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>.</p>
                <p><num style="page">182</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>It was only of the nights that Lili was afraid. Then <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> was far away, and the flowers which she had brought had
                    been removed from the room. Flowers had also come from Paris, from <persName
                        key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, and from <persName key="lejeuneClaude"
                        >Claude</persName>. And lettersâ€”these letters were the sole companions of
                    her long, long nights. And the turret clock striking the hours. And . . . the
                    pains! They started almost regularly every night. Her bed would then become a
                    glowing oven. She would lay there bathed in perspiration. The Professor had
                    ordered her to sleep; but she was to have no more morphia. Other sedatives were
                    administered to her; but they were effective only for a few hours. Then she
                    would lay awake watching for daybreak.</p>
                <p>And the day became fair again, and again there was the feeling of blissful
                    expectation. She listened for every footfallâ€”she had long since been able to
                    detect the footfall of her helper amidst all other footfalls. But he did not
                    always stop at her door. Other patients had need of him. Then she would wait
                    patiently until her turn came. Here in the clinic everybody was waiting for the
                    Professor. Everybody had to share in him, and each woman received her share,
                    even if it were only a tiny share. When he smiled she forgot all her pain.
                    Sometimes he was strict, and then she felt a mystical fear of him. And she
                    divined that he behaved quite differently towards her than towards <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. He never hinted at the past by so much as
                    a word. Was she only Lili for him? Sometimes she felt a craving to ask him about
                    it, but she never dared to do so.</p>
                <p>And for hours she would lie there and ponder</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">183</num></p>
                <p>over this oft-recurring question. She felt as if he had deprived her of her will.
                    She observed how he sought to evoke her feminine impulses by being alternately
                    mild and stern. Had he not deliberately provoked an eruption of all the
                    primitive instincts of her womanhood? She felt the transformation proceeding
                    with every new day. It was a new life. It was a new youth. It was her own youth
                    that was seeking to liberate itself. And she lay there, believing.</p>

                <p>Spring, the great miracle-worker, also came to Lili's assistance. Yet she must
                    still pass many days chained to the bed, in the white sick-room. But with each
                    new day her life became healthier. The pains departed. Everything took a normal
                    course. The Professor was satisfied. She was still utterly exhausted. And hence
                    it came about that she lay as if wrapt in a coma, and she spent most of the day
                    absorbed in herself and dreaming. The world outside did not trouble her. She was
                    hardly aware of it. Newspapers and books which were brought to her she left
                    untouched. She had only one wish: that nothing should ever be different, that
                    she could always remain here, in the peace of the Women's Clinic. And when the
                    thought sometimes occurred to her that the day would come when she would have to
                    go forth into the world outside, beyond the park wall of this large, quiet
                    house, she was assailed by overwhelming fear. Thus she developed a desire to
                    remain here as a nurse, to build up her strength in order to be able to help
                    other women once she was well. Now and then she broached the matter to <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> or to <persName key="matron">the
                        Matron</persName>, or the other nurses, who merely nodded. Once she asked
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> if she might not speak to the
                    Professor about it. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> thought she
                    might. But immediately a</p>
                <pb n="184"/>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">185</num></p>
                <p>fresh fear welled up in her. "If he should say no! Perhaps I shall not be strong
                    enough. Perhaps he will tell me that he did not save me for this. . ." And
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had no answer.</p>
                <p>During many long nights Lili's fear of life outside sought refuge in another
                    peaceful thought. Could she not enter a convent, become a nun? She fell into
                    reveries of remote, secluded convents somewhere in Italy, Spain, or South
                    Germany. No one should know there whence she had come and what a destiny had
                    been hers. No one. . . . She would weep for hours for fear of the life outside,
                    of this life which seemed to her like an enemy. There her secret would be rudely
                    unveiled, and she would be regarded as a phenomenon. Her fate would be the
                    subject of vulgar gossip; she would be stared at, and she would not be left in
                    peace. And the healthier her body became, the more vivid became her fear of her
                    future among people. Yet she no longer dared to speak about it to others.</p>
                <p>At length the morning came when she was allowed to leave the sick-room for the
                    first time. Lying back in a bath-chair she was pushed into the warm, sunny April
                    morning, into the middle of a soft green garden. It was her first untrammelled,
                    happy day. She was like a newborn babe. All her senses were fresh and full of
                    wonder. She saw every insect which fluttered in the blue sunny air and every
                    flapping of wings from tree to tree. The scent of the little yellow
                    pink-and-white spring flowers of the hedges and borders held a new message for
                    her. And with attentive eyes she regarded a magnolia tree holding up its large,
                    glistening buds to the sunny air. Upon a branch</p>
                <p><num style="page">186</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>sat two young birds huddled closely together Lili closed her eyes. A soft wind
                    played about the white birch trees. The spring soil smelt sweet and warm. The
                    birds twittered.</p>
                <p>To keep her eyes shut, only to listen, only to smell. More than this she could
                    not do. In this posture the Professor found her. "You look very happy," he said,
                    and patted her hand.</p>
                <p>"My life is your work," she reflected. "And I should so much like to thank you
                    for the first spring day of my life, because you were merciful to me. I believe
                    I am the happiest creature in the world." But all this remained unspoken; she
                    felt it only in her heart.</p>
                <p>"You look happy," said the Professor, and she merely answered:</p>
                <p>"Yes, Professor."</p>
                <p>Many happy spring days came, and at last the day also came when she could be
                    lifted out of the invalid's chair and walk a few steps in the garden on
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s arm. Everything was as before,
                    and yet everything seemed so changed, she thought. And on all the paths she saw
                    again young, pregnant women, like blue crocuses, as she thought, smiling.</p>
                <p>One morning, before she had strolled out into the park, <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> and <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName> came into
                    her room and handed her a sealed letter, which had come from Berlin. She opened
                    the letter, and a profound emotion overwhelmed her. A few weeks before the
                    Professor had told her that he would assist her to confront the world for what
                    she was, a woman. He had promised her to write to the Danish Embassy in Berlin.
                    Now she took from the envelope a passport, her own passport with her</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">187</num></p>
                <p>own photograph, and upon the passport was written the name which she had chosen
                    out of gratitude to the city where she had found peace and life itself:
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili Elbe</persName>.</p>
                <p>She sank into the chair and said very softly: "Leave me alone now for a little
                    while." <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName key="matron"
                        >the Matron</persName> understood and went out. For a long time <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName> remained sitting very quietly on the chair.
                    She then went softly and diffidently into the park, and sat on a seat which was
                    flooded by sunshine. This little booklet, her passport, she held like a valuable
                    present in both hands. It was the last day but one of April. In two days it
                    would be the first of May. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had kept
                    his promise. He was dead, and she was aliveâ€”<persName key="courtaud">Lili
                        Elbe</persName>.</p>
                <p>So the Professor found her. He sat down beside her. Not a word was said. The next
                    morning he came again, and his voice was softer than usual. His rather stern
                    face beamed with benevolence. He held her hands and spoke many hopeful words to
                    her. Lili knew that in a few hours he would depart, and be away for several
                    weeks. She pulled herself together and tried to thank him for all he had been to
                    her. But she could not utter a word. When he had gone she felt utterly lost.
                    Only one thing gave her consolation: that she was allowed to remain in this
                    asylum which he had given her, and that she might here await his return.</p>
                <p>He was leaving for the South.</p>
                <p>A few days later everything had become lonely and empty. Easter was over and
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was saying good-bye. She was
                    obliged to return to Paris for some time. It was a Monday morning. The car which
                    was to take <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> to the station
                    stopped</p>

                <p>on the drive in front of the hospital. Lili went with her to the vehicle. It was
                    the first time that Lili had ventured into the world without, beyond the park
                    wall. When Lili returned alone through the park, it was some time before she
                    realized whither she was going.</p>

                <p>Letters passed from Lili to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> in Paris
                    and from <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> back to <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. The whole city was bathed in spring. The
                    patients spent many hours on the banks of the broad stream which Lili had seen
                    for the first time a few weeks before when she came from Berlin. How the world
                    and her life had changed since that day! <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName> mentioned this in every letter she wrote. They were mostly
                    cheerful letters, breathing serenity and the blitheness of spring. And the
                    letters which <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> received from Paris
                    brought none but joyous news and many cordial wishes. <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> often conveyed greetings from <persName key="rossiniEl"
                        >Elena</persName> and <persName key="rossiniEr">Ernesto</persName>. From
                        <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> came treasured words. Hardly
                    a day passed without bringing a message from friends to <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>. And hardly a day passed but that Lili wrote gay, confident
                    words to her friends. Days and weeks went by quietly, without Lili asking a
                    question.</p>
                <p>All her burdens seemed to have slipped away. If she could only stay here always!
                    Never go away from here! That was her daily prayer. And so she forgot her fear.
                    She felt invulnerable against all adversity. She was like a piece of ground that
                    was cleared for the first time. And when of a night, at first shyly and then
                    with increasing confidence, she contemplated her body, she experienced a sweet
                    secret joy. For she saw all her members</p>

                    And in these nocturnal hours, quite alone with herself and her joy, she could
                    stand in front of the mirror and gaze at the picture of her young woman's body.
                    It gleamed back at her immaculate from the silvery sheen of the mirror. Yet she
                    dared not confide in any creature upon earth the happiness which she felt in
                    these silent hours. Not even in her letters.</p>

                <p>"How changed is everything here in the private ward! Formerly the days were
                    passed eventfully enough, or in the expectation of events, and now nothing
                    happens any longer. On the day of your departure <persName key="matron">the
                        Matron</persName> was called to Berlin on family business. During her

                    Margaret.</p>
                <p>"Every day sees the departure of women who are cured. And fresh patients come.
                    There are now three of us in the private ward, and we are sunning ourselves
                    outside in the garden, in invalid chairs on the lawn. There is a fair little
                    lady, still very young, whom I like very much. She looks most attractive. We
                    smile at each other now and then from a distance. But that is all up to now. I
                    do not like the garden any longer. You have gone. And the Professor has gone.
                    What shall I tell you? I don't know. An oppressive silence reigns here now. Even
                    in my room I walk about softly, as if I feared to</p>

                <p>"Thanks for your letter. It was such a distraction. I am glad that you have
                    fallen into the way of your work again.</p>
                <p>"I have made the acquaintance of the little fair lady. When one of the doctors
                    was passing yesterdayâ€”we were lying in our chairs out in the gardenâ€”we suddenly
                    looked at each other and smiled. So it began. And then we started chatting. It
                    transpired that she is half a Dane, her mother coming from Denmark. She said: 'I
                    guessed at once that you are a Dane, from your long slender legs, just like
                    mine. They are the Northern speciality. I inherited my legs from my mother.' And
                    then she proudly showed me 'her Northern speciality'. How glad I am to have once
                    more a person with whom I can converse! The nurses have nick-named her Mrs.
                    Teddybear, on account of her woollen cloak, which she always wears in the
                    garden. Then she said: 'I think we have the same figure. We could certainly wear
                    the same clothes and shoes.' I think so too. Unfortunately she is not yet
                    allowed to go for a walk, otherwise we should have gone into the town together.
                    She has to undergo an after-treatment, which will take some time. The third
                    lady, Mrs. Teddybear told me, is an opera singer from North Germany. She is
                    supposed to have undergone a difficult operation.</p>
                <p>"I read newspapers, which tell me what the</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>weather is like with you in Paris and on the Riviera, where the Professor now is.
                    Have you given <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> my
                    greetings?"</p>
                <p>"9th May.</p>
                <p>"Everything here is still wrapped in magic slumber. We hear nothing of the
                    Professor. Nobody knows when <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName> will
                    return. Early this morning a fourth lady joined us in the garden, a young woman
                    who has just had a child.</p>
                <p>"Mrs. Teddybear and I have become close friends in the meantime. She has poured
                    out to me her little overcharged heart. She and her husband are not on good
                    terms. She hears almost nothing from him. Yesterday she showed me in her room a
                    portrait of her husband. I believe she is very sad. The poor thing! She is
                    scarcely twenty years old. Suddenly she asked afterâ€”my husband! I had to pull
                    myself together, for I must not betray myself. And so I merely hinted that
                    matters were much worse with me, so bad that I could not speak about them. Then
                    she did not ask any further questions. She only looked at me very sadly. Her
                    eyes glistened with tears. And I was in no better case. And then we smiled
                    again.</p>
                <p>"I am so glad that she has given me her confidence. She is the first woman to
                    pour out her heart to me in my woman's existence.</p>
                <p>"We are now inseparable. With the nurses I stroll about the garden. In the
                    evenings we walk through the streets a little, to look at the passers-by.
                    Yesterday afternoon I went with</p>

                <p>Sister Frieda as far as the Elbe. Then we adjourned to a little cafÃ© and ate
                    cakes. My first proper walk."</p>
                <p>"10th May.</p>
                <p>"To-day I am able to tell you something amusing. The young lady who had a baby
                    has a dear old mother who comes daily and always stays a long time. Yesterday in
                    the garden she nodded to me in a friendly fashion, and this morning, as I was
                    lying in the invalid's chair, she came to me, gave me her hand, and asked
                    sympathetically: 'How are you, little woman? I suppose you too have had a baby?'
                    I was embarrassed. But that lasted only a moment. Then I said evasively that I
                    had undergone two operations. Probably the old lady did not hear very well, or
                    misunderstood my answer. I had spoken very softly. And do you know what she
                    answered? '<hi rend="italic">Two</hi> babies?' No, that is really too much for
                    you!' I had to keep a straight face. If the Professor had heard that!</p>
                <p>"If Mrs. Teddybear asks me, what shall I say? It is no joke to be in my
                    shoes."</p>
                <p>"11th May.</p>
                <p>"The head doctor has a delightful little ape, with whom he often strolls in the
                    garden. It is the dearest little creature. I want to ask him if he cannot take
                    it with him when he makes his round of visits. He is very amiable. I have got
                    quite accustomed to him. He told me this morning that I was now looking very
                    robust. I feel quite well in myself. How happy that made</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>me! I should like to look really pretty when the Professor returns. Half his
                    holiday has now expired. You will soon meet him in Paris.</p>
                <p>"I am now going for a short walk with the opera singer. Yesterday we made each
                    other's acquaintance. She speaks French quite well."</p>
                <p>"12th May.</p>
                <p>"Yesterday I exerted myself rather too much during the walk with the opera
                    singer. We had again gone to the Elbe. The weather was glorious. She told me
                    about her operation. Then we talked about the Professor. She said: 'You can have
                    no idea how much I envy you. You will be allowed to remain in the clinic a long
                    time, but my stay is nearly up. It is so lovely and peaceful here. Unfortunately
                    I am very cowardly, as I am afraid of pain. I would rather die than be operated
                    upon again. I admire your serenity. Your operations must have been very serious,
                    and yet you are expecting still another. . . .'</p>
                <p>"I had to smile cordially and even a little proudly. I said: 'Ah, one gets
                    accustomed to everything.' You ought to have seen her horrified eyes!</p>
                <p>"And so we went on chatting without noticing that we had forgotten to turn back.
                    I had become very tired. The singer simply had to drag me along. At length we
                    got back to the clinic. In future I will be more careful.</p>
                <p>"Then I must tell you about a conversation I had yesterday with a friend of
                    Teddybear. She was a pretty, elegant, and interesting woman, only
                    somewhatâ€”learned. She is a doctor here</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">195</num></p>
                <p>in Dresden. No doubt Mrs. Teddybear had told her something about myself. We
                    chatted in a very animated fashion about unimportant things. I laughed a good
                    deal. I affected a superficial and careless demeanour. That was all very well in
                    its way; but I had provoked the doctor's displeasure, Suddenly she said: 'You
                    are a hundred per cent woman.' That sounded very sympathetic. 'How do you make
                    that out?' I inquired with a smile. 'You are very coquettish and your head is
                    full of nonsense. I believe you would like the lords of creation to tyrannize
                    over you. But perhaps you achieve more by your methods than we modern women.
                    What we have to fight for you achieve in a twinkling by means of a few tears.
                    You seem to me like a female type of a vanished age.' I laughed saucily. 'And
                    may I ask what this vanished female type is like? I am extremely curious to
                    know.' The lady doctor looked at me a moment before answering very scornfully:
                    'Women like you are best suited for aâ€”harem.' What do you say to this
                    psychoanalytical diagnosis? When you see <persName key="lejeuneClaude"
                        >Claude</persName>, you must tell him. The Professor too. I laughed till I
                    cried.</p>
                <p>"Teddybearkins has given me an exact description of her operation. In her room
                    she showed me the scars it had left. She also inquired about mine. I had to
                    pretend to be downright stupid, as if I did not know why I had been operated
                    upon at all. Dearest, dearest <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, and
                    yet it is so lovely to be a woman here among women, to be a female creature

                <p>"Dearest of all.</p>
                <p>"Yesterday the head doctor visited me with his little ape. It immediately
                    installed itself on my table. Some salad had remained over from lunch, and this
                    was given the little animal. How well-mannered it was, to be sure! His master
                    was very proud. After the meal it washed its paws in a little bowl which I
                    pushed towards it. I had to laugh heartily, and I can do so now without feeling
                    any pain. Isn't that fine? This is a sure sign that everything is healed up. The
                    head doctor then said that I was now so well that I could recuperate in some
                    sanatorium. I declined emphatically. 'The Professor wants to operate on me
                    again!' He looked serious for a moment. 'All right,' he then said, and smiled;
                    'but that will only be a minor operation.' Well, I said nothing, but thought the

                <p>"I am so excited over your letter. Perhaps you know when the Professor returns.
                    Here no one knows anything. The nurses think that <persName key="matron">the

                    to learn what is going on in my mind. It is hard, but it is also splendid. Now I
                    shall count the days and soon the hours . . . and then the Professor will be
                    here again. You will certainly understand my longing. What should I be without

                    The whole of the private ward is now undergoing a great spring-cleaning.
                    Everything smells of soap, soda, polish, and new curtains. The clinic is getting
                    ready for the return of its lord and master. The nurses skip along so swiftly
                    that their white skirts look like bellying sails in the wind. Ilseâ€”the little
                    maid who waits on meâ€”is polishing the lock of the door in my room. Everything is
                    shining and sparkling. And she herself glows like one of the newly opened roses

                    a stern face. She has come here for her confinement. Teddybearkins says it will
                    be a girl. Hence it will not be born until the Professor is back. Boys make no
                    bones about getting born, but girls can only come into the world with the help
                    of the Professor. Her logic is very amusing."</p>

                    behind the clock-turret near the Professor's balcony. The bright red blossoms of
                    the magnolia treeâ€”you know itâ€”give off a heavy scent. I am overjoyed! I am lying
                    in the chaise-longue, in the centre of the garden, and writing to you. It is my
                    Garden of Eden. Soon the Professor will be here again. The rhododendron bushes
                    under his balcony are in bloom. Like great lilac flames they gleam between the
                    fir trees. I have to keep looking and smiling at the balcony. The turret clock
                    is striking six. The thought suddenly occurs to me that you, <persName
                        key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, and the Professor are now talking to each
                    other in Paris. Perhaps you will be with <persName key="rossiniEr"

                    evening. My thoughts try to flit through space to you. It is a strangely quiet
                    hour around me. When was I so glad as I am to-day?</p>

                    mysterious. She looked at me astonished. She was not aware that I had received a
                    letter from you.</p>
                <p>"What a scent from the magnolia tree! The whole of spring is contained in its
                    fragrance. A petal has fallen on my chaise-longue. The magnolia tree wants to
                    send you greetings. You shall have the petal. I cannot write any more now. I
                    will only think, in blissful silence, of you and my happiness."</p>

                <p>"He came this morning.</p>
                <p>"I had made myself as pretty as possible. At first I dared not leave my
                    roomâ€”until it became intolerable. I crept along the corridor and spoke to one or
                    two nurses. Suddenly the large folding door opened behind me, and in a trice the
                    sisters disappeared. . . . I stood alone . . . as if nailed to the floor, and
                    could not move.</p>
                <p>"'Good morning,' I heard a voice say behind me. My knees trembled. He came
                    towards me, embraced me, and regarded me with a smile. 'You look fine,' he said.
                    I had to lean against the wall, to avoid swooning. I stammered a few stupid
                    words; but he had already disappeared. And what did I do? I went back to my room
                    dejected, and wept. Somewhat later the Professor came to me in the course of his
                    rounds. I had calmed down again and was quite rational; I could listen with
                    composure and without trembling. He told me about you and <persName
                        key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>. He also said that you would soon</p>

                        <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>. It was wrapped in a green silk
                    band. And what did it contain? A perfectly ravishing nightdress! The Professor
                    smiled when I showed him <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>'s
                    present.</p>
                <p>"You see how correctly I guessed? About six o'clock in the evening of the day
                    before yesterday you were together. My feelings did not deceive me!</p>
                <p>"Now I am waiting impatiently for your letter. I hope it will tell me everything
                    that the Professor has told you about me. I feel very exhaustedâ€”of the joys of
                    this fine day. Joys, too, consume strength. I do not as yet possess such a

                <p> "I could not write yesterday. Teddybearkins visited me. It was delightful,
                    although I did not believe that she came <hi rend="italic">exclusively</hi> on
                    my account. Thenâ€”think of itâ€”I went out alone. Alone for the first time. I am
                    now allowed to do so. I bought various things: silk stockings, powder,
                    confectionery, and the like. How delightful it is to be addressed as 'madam'!
                    You must not smile when you read this. I have also bought some lipstick. 'Take
                    these, madam; guaranteed kiss-proof,' declared the shopkeeper. I bought it with
                    a smile. When I told <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName> about this,
                    she also smiled. Then I wondered to myself whether my smile was not somewhat
                    melancholy. I saw the little shop assistant in my mind's eye. For her it is
                    certainly desirable to use kiss-proof lipstick. But for me? No, no, no, what am
                    I saying? It would be best to delete this passage.</p>
                <p> "I have received a delightful letter from <persName key="rossiniEl"
                        >Elena</persName>. She too mentioned a conversation with the Professor about
                    my new operation. I did not understand everything she said. Should I ask the
                    Professor? It would not come easy to me. He has a strange way of making me
                    submissive <persName key="matron">Matron</persName> and the nurses are quite
                    incensed over my 'transformation' since the Professor's return;</p>

                    to ask him when my next operation is to take place."</p>
                <p>"23rd May.</p>
                <p>"What a disappointment! To-day the Professor came alone to meâ€”without <persName
                        key="matron">Matron</persName>. And I plucked up courage. Very cautiously I
                    put a few questions about my new operation. He cut me off short by saying that I
                    was not to let my mind dwell upon the subject. <hi rend="italic">Basta!</hi> I
                    wanted to excuse myself, and said that I had only asked out of foolish
                    curiosity. I behaved like a schoolgirl. Then I felt his gaze. 'All right, all
                    right. Don't think about such things. Why do you want to burden your young life
                    in this way? Just go on living for the day, without bothering, and leave all the
                    rest to me.' Then he went. I remained sitting in my room crushed. Of course, I
                    understood quite well that I ought not to bother myself about the matter.
                    Sometimes I think that he is treating me in such a way as to obliterate every
                    trace of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> which might still be
                    slumbering in me. Certainly this must be why he is so strict with me. If that is
                    really his intention, he is succeeding. You must believe me when I say that I
                    have forgotten <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and everything
                    connected with him. For me he is a dead person. If by chance a recollection
                    arises in me, I see nothing but clouds, vague clouds. But I should like to know
                    just how long the Professor intends leaving me out at grass pending the last
                    operation. I am longing for a letter from you. When are you coming?"</p>

                <p>"24th May.</p>
                <p>"This will be quite a short letter. I have been in the town with Mrs. Teddybear
                    the whole afternoon. We went into a number of large costumiers' shops and
                    inspected clothes, hats, and other delightful things. I bought a pair of very
                    pretty shoes with the highest heels that I could findâ€”a combination of varnish
                    and snakeskin. They look perfectly delightful. To-morrow we are again going on
                    the spree. It does me good to go out into the bustle of the town. Otherwise, the
                    waiting for the operation would get on my nerves. I hardly see the Professor
                    these days; moreover, he has a lot to do. Since his return there have been many
                    fresh operations every day."</p>
                <p>"25th May.</p>
                <p>"At last! To-morrow it comes off! When shortly after breakfast I was about to say
                    goodbye to <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName>â€”Mrs. Teddybear was
                    already there waiting for meâ€”she explained briefly and to the point: 'You cannot
                    go out to-day. You must go back to bed immediately, as you are to be operated
                    upon to-morrow.' I had to obey. Teddybearkins went with me to my room, in order
                    to console me. Soon <persName key="matron">Matron</persName> came, sat beside
                    me, chatted to us both, and once more assured me that the new operation was a
                    trifle. Then she took Mrs. Teddybear away with her, and I was left alone with my
                    thoughts.</p>
                <p>"Even operations tend to become a matter of routine! Strangely enough, I had
                    tidied up my wardrobe and chest of drawers early that</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>morning. It looked like a presentiment. Everything was now in its place. I had
                    only to say to the nurses: 'In the right-hand drawer are night-dresses and in
                    the drawer below handkerchiefs, etc.' My 'beauty-parlour' I had fixed up in a
                    press beside the bed. Thus I had everything which I needed ready to hand. Your
                    vain Lili would always like to look prettyâ€”even when she is being operated upon.
                    I must do the Professor credit.</p>
                <p>"I have had to leave off writing for a short time. Sister Frieda has been with
                    me. The indispensable and not altogether pleasant preparations are over. I am
                    somewhat exhausted. Hence for a few moments I felt very disheartened. The
                    thought occurred to me that it would perhaps be best if I did not survive the
                    new operation. I realize that it is a serious thingâ€”and probably very painful
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>"A few days before I had asked <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName> in
                    jocular mood whether a local anÃ¦sthetic would not be sufficient this time, as I
                    had a desire to watch the Professor while he was operating. Moreover, to combine
                    the useful with the pleasant, I should have something more of the Professor's
                    company in this way. His daily visits, in fact, only lasted a few minutes.
                        <persName key="matron">The Matron</persName> looked at me quite
                    horrified.</p>
                <p>"'Impossible! We do not employ local anÃ¦sthetics here, least of all with
                    abdominal operations.'</p>
                <p>"I hung my head. I wanted to cry. Suddenly I felt a sickly terror. One day I

                    where I have been so happy? But the next moment I realized that I must not think
                    of such things, and that I must not think of dying. That would be treachery
                    towards the Professor, after all he has done for me. No, I will not die. I know
                    that I shall pull through."</p>

                    While I was looking in the mirror, and raising my arm as if dancing, it suddenly
                    struck me that this silk night-dress was more appropriate for a bridal night
                    than for an operation. Quickly I slipped it off, and put on a quite simple
                    gown.</p>
                <p>"Now I hear an ambulance coming. I think it is stopping in front of my door. The
                    nurses will soon be here now.</p>
                <p>"If it should turn out badly, you must thank the Professor for all that he has
                    done and tell him that I spent the happiest time of my life in the Women's
                    Clinic. Also give my greeting to <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> and
                        <persName key="rossiniEr">Ernesto</persName>â€”and <persName
                        key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>. I often think of him. Yesterday I
                    received a dear letter from him. Tell him that I will soon write.</p>
                <p>"Dearest <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, everything of good in my
                    life has come from you and the Professor."</p>

                <p>"27th May.</p>
                <p>"Now things are somewhat better. At the moment of writing I feel scarcely any
                    pain. I know the Professor telegraphed you that everything passed off well.
                    Yesterday's awakening was horrible.</p>
                <p>"'You must keep your legs still,' said the Professor. Only then did I notice that
                    my legs were continually movingâ€”as if I were cycling. With pain! And then they
                    did not stir againâ€”as if they were paralysed. So great is his power over your
                    poor <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>.</p>
                <p>"Afterwards he bound my legs fast to a heavy sand-cushion.</p>
                <p>"I have no idea how the afternoon and night have passed! I only know it was
                    horrible. But do not be uneasy; things are somewhat better now."</p>
                <p>"28th May.</p>
                <p>"Thanks for letter and telegram. You need not worry. However terrible my present
                    state is, it must be endured. Yesterday, after waking up, the young nurse who
                    was keeping watch beside me said: 'Try to smile just for once, madamâ€”the
                    Professor is coming again in a moment.' Otherwise I cannot recall his being with
                    me. God knows how much morphia I have taken since the day before yesterday.
                    Probably my groans and screams could be heard a mile away. Prior to the last two
                    days I had no suspicion of what pain really meant. Yesterday evening the little
                    sister sat beside my bed and wept, I believe out of sympathy. But to-morrow</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">207</num></p>
                <p>I shall certainly be better, and then I will write again."</p>
                <p>"29th May</p>
                <p>"How dear of you to write every day! It comforts me in my misery. The worst is
                    that I must not move. I have a tube in the abdomen, and consequently I must keep
                    my legs still. Thank God, I can move my arms, otherwise it could not be
                    endured.</p>
                <p>"I do not like to show myself to the Professorâ€”without powder and rouge. In the
                    morning I spend whole hours on my toiletâ€”however hard I find it. Often my arms
                    drop out of sheer weariness. You have no idea what exertion it calls forth, and
                    the result is mostly insignificant. Vanity? Perhaps it is just my vanity which
                    is sustaining me these days. It is the means of giving me some occupation.
                    Sometimes I even think that the most immortal element in me is my vanity.</p>
                <p>"There is a new nurse, who is called Ellen, and who is always good-humoured. She
                    and the little Frieda look after me in turn. They are terribly good to me. I may
                    not yet laugh. It hurts so. If only you can come soon!"</p>
                <p>"31st May.</p>
                <p>"I have just passed two more terrible days. Consequently you have not heard from
                    me. Just as I thought the worst was over, I was suddenly gripped with terrible
                    pains. The Professor, who was fortunately in the neighbourhood, was summoned. I
                    was pushed headlong into an examination room. At first, on the way, I
                    groanedâ€”</p>
                <p><num style="page">208</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>but when several strange ladies passed us I pulled myself together. I did not
                    want to show weakness in front of strangers.</p>
                <p>"During the examination my knees were clamped to the bed. I felt so miserable
                    that I scarcely noticed what was happening to me. I only saw the Professor
                    standing in front of the window, his back turned to me. 'Count,' he said, and
                    then I became aware of the repellent odour of ether. It lasted longer than
                    usual. I came to 37. When I awoke the doctors were there to put me to bed. Then
                    I heard someone laugh. I had, in fact, called out: 'Where is the little ape?' I
                    had dreamed that the little ape which belonged to the head doctor was sitting
                    beside me and eating my salad.</p>
                <p>"The next day, which was yesterday, the pains started again. Again the Professor
                    had to be fetched; but this time there was no anÃ¦sthetic! I screamed terribly,
                    and afterwards violently reproached myself for doing so I saw from the
                    Professor's expression that he was suffering with me; but I could not control
                    myself. When it was over I was given a larger dose of morphia, but it was some
                    time before it took proper effect. I noticed my thoughts were becoming confused.
                    I heard myself groaning and screaming as if from a long distance, and always the
                    same thing: 'Give me my clothes. I will jump off the cliff! I will not die in
                    the clinic, to please the Professor.'</p>
                <p>"<persName key="matron">Matron</persName>, and silent, pale Sister Hannah, sat
                    beside my bed. I sensed their presence as if through a cloud, and felt that they

                <p>to console and calm me. At last I cried myself off to sleep.</p>
                <p>"When I awoke, I felt somewhat better. Then I discovered the tube was choked up.
                    When the Professor was with me in the evening, I excused myself for my
                    uncontrollable behaviour.</p>
                <p>"'Now, don't be too sensitive. I know you have had agonizing pains,' he said.
                    'Not on that account, Professor, but out of respect for you I am sorry that I
                    misbehaved,' I said. Then he took my arm, patted it, and smiled down on me
                    affably and soothingly. Everything I had suffered was obliterated and forgotten
                    through this smile. You see, I am much better to-day, else I could not have
                    written you such a long letter.</p>
                <p>"Come soon. The Professor is also asking after you."</p>
                <p>"1st June.</p>
                <p>"Now progress is really rapid. I think the Professor's smile yesterday evening
                    gave me new vitality. I keep recalling it. It was also high time, for it was a
                    long time since he had smiled on me.</p>
                <p>"Since the last operation he has always looked very stern. I do not think he is
                    pleased with the poor progress I am making. I was very unfortunate! He has
                    certainly good reason to be stern. Perhaps it was a mask, as he is fighting for
                    my life. There was not time for outward display of sympathy. Perhaps such
                    emotions would have been too much for me.</p>
                <p>"Now I feel that I am returning to lifeâ€”</p>
                <p><num style="page">210</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>although I am still lying with the tube inside me and my legs tightly bound.</p>
                <p>"I shall never forget all that sister Ellen and sister Frieda have been to me
                    during these dark days. They were my good fairies. They have a place in my
                    heart.</p>
                <p>"Little Ilse brings me fresh flowers from the garden every day. In the evening
                    she or Sister Frieda sits with me. Then the gramophone plays. How music soothes
                    my nerves!</p>
                <p>"More than once it seemed as if the tube had got out of position; but it was
                    always pushed back. I long so much to be able to move my legs a little!
                    Moreover, I know that I shall not go out into the garden until everything is
                    over. When the window is open and the scent of blossoms is streaming in, I long
                    so terribly for my seat on the lawn under my beautiful magnolia tree.</p>
                <p>"Thank you a thousand times for your letter."</p>
                <p>"3rd June.</p>
                <p>"Yesterday Teddybearkins was again with me. She was the purest sprite, laughing
                    and relating stupidities. I had just had my breakfast. As I had a very poor
                    appetite, she ate everything up in a twinkling. Then she sat on the window-seat,
                    dangled her long, pretty legs out of the window, and smoked one cigarette after
                    another. Suddenly we heard the folding door outside being opened. Like a flash
                    she was out of the window. The next moment, the Professor, accompanied by
                        <persName key="matron">Matron</persName>, entered the room.</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">211</num></p>
                <p>"He certainly noticed the cigarette-smokeâ€”he looked at me rather strangely. I
                    could not, of course, utter a sound.</p>
                <p>"'Look what an appetite Frau Lili has got now!' said <persName key="matron"
                        >Matron</persName>, beaming and pointing to the empty plates. They were
                    scarcely outside the room before I heard a ringing laugh. Smoking in the rooms
                    is strictly forbidden. But I surmised that out of sympathy with me, <persName
                        key="matron">Matron</persName> explained to the Professor that I was not the
                    sinner.</p>
                <p>"Early this morning Teddybearkins was here again. And then I could take my
                    revenge. She had brought her friend, the lady doctor, with her. Mrs. Teddybear
                    then told us that she was once obliged to wait several hours for a consultation
                    with the Professor. 'Here one learns to wait,' she had then said to the
                    Professor. 'Yes, that is the first thing <hi rend="italic">I</hi> teach young
                    ladies,' the friend answered, quick as lightning. And then they both declared
                    with one voice that it was really ludicrous to be afraid of the Professor, that
                    my respect for him was too comical for words. He was the most amiable man; but a
                    modern woman who was afraid of one man was a ridiculous creature. They had
                    scarcely finished chaffing me before the door opened and the Professor was
                    standing in the room. And both my modern champions of the sex withdrew
                    blushingly and almost panic-stricken. Not until long after the Professor had
                    evacuated the field did they venture to put in an appearance. Teddybearkins was
                    then very dejected. But the learned madam of the medical faculty again rode the
                    high horse. 'That's the way to subjugate</p>
                <p><num style="page">212</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>slave natures. It won't suit me.' 'But why did you not remain?' I asked with
                    curiosity. 'I could not leave my poor little friend in the lurch!' For the first
                    time I laughed heartily again. It really hurt me to do so. And Teddybearkins
                    wore a very guilty expression.</p>
                <p>"Shall I have a line from you to-morrow to tell me when you are coming?"</p>
                <p>"4th June.</p>
                <p>"I have got over everything now. The objectionable tube has been taken away.
                    Early this morning. Suddenly the Professor came inâ€”with Sister Margaret, who was
                    carrying a tray with instruments. If I see instruments I have palpitations. But
                    this time everything happened so quickly that I had scarcely time to think about
                    it. In a few minutes everything was settled. I began to whimper with joy, like a
                    foolish little girl. 'Does it still hurt?' asked the Professor. 'No, noâ€”on the
                    contrary.' Then he had to smile. 'If everything functions normally, you will
                    have an injection,' he said shortly, and departed.</p>
                <p>"When he returned two hours later, I was beaming with happiness. Everything had
                    passed off normally.</p>
                <p>"'Now I am reassured,' he said. I saw that he was satisfied with me.</p>
                <p>"I learned afterwards that all the nurses had worn very anxious expressions the
                    whole day. If everything had not been in order after the removal of the tube, it
                    would have been necessary to operate upon me again immediately,</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">213</num></p>
                <p>and it was doubtful whether my strength would have proved adequate.</p>
                <p>"What a wonderful feeling to be able to stretch one's legs again! After lying
                    still for so long my whole body still feels as if it were paralysed. But I am
                    deliriously happy now, because I know that you will be with me in a few days.
                    Perhaps by then I shall be out in the garden again. Oh, <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, how beautiful life is! And what a stroke
                    of good fortune that I have been able to spend this lovely summer here! And if
                    there should be no second summer, I have had my fill of happiness. At least I
                    shall have known what midsummer happiness is like!"</p>
                <p>"5th June.</p>
                <p>"I hasten to write you a few lines. It will be the last letter that can reach you
                    before you leave Paris.</p>
                <p>"To-day I was to try to get up; but my legs would not support me. Sisters Frieda
                    and Ellen had eventually to lift me out of bed and place me in the armchair.
                    Still, it was lovely.</p>
                <p>"The armchair is close to the window, and I can look out into the garden. They
                    have promised to let me go out into the garden again in the morning.</p>
                <p>"I really look very tired. I tell you this only so that you shouldn't have a

                <p>Once more Lili was lying in her chaise-longue outside in the park. It was now
                    summer. Bees flew humming from flower to flower, and the birds were singing in
                    the trees. The silver birches were now clad in their richest foliage, and when
                    the wind rustled through them it seemed to Lili as though little bells
                    tinkled.</p>
                <p>Then someone called her name: "<persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>!"</p>
                <p>And the next moment she was enfolded in <persName key="sparreGre"

                <p>Then followed days full of happiness and security. <persName key="sparreGre"

                    Lili now began to take timidly upon the summery paths of the park. And Lili grew
                    visibly better with every day that passed. Soon she could stroll through the
                    park again, free from all pain and all fatigue. Then, arm in arm, like two
                    affectionate sisters, the pair went on voyages of exploration into the town.</p>
                <p>One evening, as she was entering the park with <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>, the Professor met her.</p>
                <p>"I am quite well now, Professor. But . . ." She hesitated.</p>
                <p>"Well?"</p>
                <p>"Could I not stay here a few months longer with you, in case you should want to
                    operate upon me again?"</p>

                <p><num style="page">215</num></p>
                <p>He looked at her with a smile and shook his head. "No; it is high time for you to
                    go out into the world and try your wings."</p>
                <p>The same evening Lili found a bird's nest. It was built under the roof of the
                    covered passage which led from the Professor's private quarters to the clinic. A
                    small family of sparrows. The father sparrow and the mother sparrow were
                    twittering and the young sparrows were chirping. Perhaps a little family
                    quarrel, thought <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. Suddenly a young one
                    fell out of the nest and remained lying help less on the path. It fluttered its
                    embryo wings and tried to fly, but in vain. The wings were not strong enough to
                    bear it. And the parents came hurrying out of the nest on to the path and
                    hovered about their young one. Their twittering sounded a note of real terror.
                    They could not get the youngster back into the nest. Then Lili stooped down,
                    took the little bird in her hand, stroked it carefully, and felt the little
                    heart beating against her hand. Suddenly <persName key="matron">the
                        Matron</persName> was standing beside her.</p>
                <p>"But why are you weeping, Frau <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>?" </p>
                <p>Mutely Lili handed her the little bird. "It has fallen out of the nest and cannot
                    yet fly. And the parents cannot help it. It makes me think of myself. I too
                    cannot yet . . ."</p>
                <p>She gave <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName> the bird, and <persName
                        key="matron">the Matron</persName> fetched a ladder and laid the bird again
                    in the nest among its parents and brothers and sisters.</p>
                <p>The day of departure from Dresden passed off much more quietly than <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had anticipated. When <persName>the
                        Professor</persName> came to bid Lili farewell,</p>
                <p><num style="page">216</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>she skid to him simply and calmly: "I owe you, <persName>Professor</persName>,
                    not only my life, but also hope for the future, and all the confidence which I
                    am now feeling. I will now try to plunge into the world outsideâ€”but if I am in
                    need, may I come back?"</p>
                <p>The Professor only pressed her hand. "Write and tell me where you are, how you
                    are getting on, and what you are doing. And regularly. Tell me everything. And
                    if you want my help, you will always find a refuge and friends here."</p>
                <p>Lili bade farewell to <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName> and the other
                    nurses. When they left the porch and she saw her luggage piled high on the car,
                    she thought with relief how simply and naturally everything was now arranging
                    itself, and how unpathetic and undramatic life was when seen in daylight. The
                    day before, and also the whole night, she had been full of apprehension at this
                    approaching moment of farewell; full of fear and apprehension of life outside
                    the sheltered clinic. Now, in the twinkling of an eye, she was sitting in the
                    train with <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> on the journey to
                    Berlin.</p>
                <p>And only many, many months later did she realize what a harsh transition from the
                    peace of the Women's Clinic to the outside world was the sojourn in Berlin. She
                    understood subsequently why she had been sent out of her paradise on the Elbe
                    into the noisiest of all cities that she had ever seen. For these Berlin days
                    were intended to give her an opportunity to test herself, to prove her vitality
                    and her capacity for living. She stayed in a hotel, quite close to the clinic in
                    which she, as a man, had been lying a few months before. She felt no curiosity
                    to revisit this place of transition,</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">217</num></p>
                <p>as she subsequently called it. Nor had she any desire to visit the friends of
                    that time. To move, to live, to gaze and wander unknown and anonymous among the
                    millions of the giant city, to grow accustomed to the workaday rhythm of others,
                    so that she could one day share in this rhythm herselfâ€”such was the deepest
                    meaning of this Berlin sojourn.</p>
                <p>She was not always accompanied by <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> on
                    her strolls through the Tiergarten, through the museums and through the noisiest
                    and most animated streets. She often wanted to be alone, thrown quite back on
                    her own resources, in order to find her feet in the whirlpool of Berlin. For
                    that was itâ€”she must find her own feet, in order to demonstrate to herself that
                    she would be able to go her own way when left to herself. <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> let her have her way. She was secretly glad
                    at Lili's participation in the great and little things of the day, although she
                    certainly suspected that Lili was having the hardest possible struggle with
                    herself during these Berlin days.</p>
                <p>So it was. There were days through which Lili dragged a tortured and lacerated
                    heart, days when she was oppressed by numerous fears. It is so easy, she would
                    then think, to bear one's anonymous fate here among utter strangers; but how
                    would everything shape as soon as this anonymity ceased, as soon as she was
                    obliged to appear in those circles whence <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> has vanished, to which <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> had belonged? She thought of her family in Denmark.
                    Supposing she never returned there? Would that not be the simplest? Would it not
                    be better for her, the new creature without a past and thus without</p>
                <p><num style="page">218</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>a family, to renounce everything connected with <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>? To renounce her friends and relations in Denmark? To
                    renounce even the friends in Paris, in order to start a new life right from the
                    beginning?</p>
                <p>She surrendered herself to such thoughts with fanaticism, with an obstinacy that
                    eventually suggested to her the question as to whether she ought not to part
                    from <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> for ever, secretly, slipping
                    away without a word? Or ought she to speak to <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>, to tell her in quiet, simple words that their ways must
                    now part? But hardly had she addressed this question to herself than she shrank
                    from the probe. Life and the world about her, everything would become empty and
                    cold if she should renounce everything that once surrounded <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. Would it not even be cowardice, the
                    confession of a guilty feeling, if she should break all the ties with the
                    pastâ€”with the past of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>? Would not
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> become lonely if she should part
                    from her for ever?</p>
                <p>These days of futile questionings were followed by nights when Lili lay sleepless
                    and pondered upon everything that had happened to herâ€”to <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>â€”to <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>. And the more intimately, the more longingly, the more
                    ardently she let her thoughts wander through the corridors of the past, the more
                    terrified she became. For she perceived that her whole mental life had been
                    really obliterated from the day when she had been newly created in the city by
                    the Elbe.</p>
                <p>A horror came upon her when she saw her questions confronting her without answer,
                    as if before a mistâ€”a mist which became thicker and thicker</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">219</num></p>
                <p>and eventually extinguished everything which had formerly been. Faces which
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had known faded away. A desert
                    surrounded her, an empty waste wherein not even phantoms emerged from the
                    past.</p>
                <p>During such nights she felt close to madness; she dared not confide all that she
                    went through at this time to another person, not even to <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. Only two names grew clearer and clearer in
                    her present anguish. And to the names were attached two faces, one of which
                    belonged to <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>, and the other to
                        <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName>, the young Italian officer,
                    who, an age ago, as she thought now, although it was really no more than a year,
                    had been with them together in Rome. <persName key="feruzziRi"
                        >Feruzzi</persName>, with whom <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                    felt some secret tie, as if instinctively imploring the protection of a man,
                    without being conscious of it in her own mind and without even mentioning his
                    name during these latter weeks. And the more ardently Lili conjured up in her
                    heart the picture of the Italian friend, the more distinctly she felt his
                    features mingling with the picture of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>.</p>
                <p>All of a sudden it dawned upon her what a profound and strange secret was bound
                    up with the vow which, on a far-off evening in Rome, when <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>, and <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName> were
                    sitting together, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> himself had taken:
                    that <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName key="feruzziRi"
                        >Feruzzi</persName> should be united because they belonged to each other,
                    and that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> should disappear.</p>
                <p>One night Lili suddenly woke up, stole softly to <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>, and took her hand.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was sleeping. She awoke in a fright
                    and saw Lili beside her.</p>
                <p>"Have I awakened you?" asked <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>.</p>

                <p>"Oh, I was having such a beautiful dream!" said <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>.</p>
                <p>"Where were you in your dreams?" asked <persName key="courtaud"
                    >Lili</persName>.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> answered: "I think we were in
                    Rome."</p>
                <p>"And <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName> was with you, wasn't he?" asked
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. Then <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> put her arm round Lili and Lili her arm round <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. And neither spoke another word.</p>
                <p>The next morning Lili wrote a short and calm note to <persName key="feruzziRi"
                        >Feruzzi</persName>:</p>
                <p>"Dear Friend,</p>
                <p>"I will only tell you that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> has kept
                    his word. He is dead. I know that <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> has
                    not yet told you anything about it. Write her and do not neglect her."</p>
                <p>Underneath she signed her name, "<persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>."</p>
                <p>After about a week she returned to Dresdenâ€”to Lili's home. And again they went
                    like two sisters through the park of the Women's Clinic, and the Professor
                    rejoiced in them. Again they said farewell, and, at his behest, proceeded to a
                    quiet woodland village in the Erzgebirge, stayed in a little hotel, lived in the
                    society of other people who were strangers, and, like them, seeking a few weeks'
                    convalescence. One day a letter came from Italy for <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> gave the
                    letter to Lili to read. <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName> wrote to
                    say that he was at the service of both of them, wherever they were and wherever
                    he was, and that if they called he would come, and that his heart belonged to
                    them both. Lili felt this day for the first time in her life as a woman that she
                    had paid</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">221</num></p>
                <p>off some of her debt to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and that she
                    had bestowed some happiness upon two other persons. And then <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> learned what vow <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> had sworn in Rome regarding himself and her and
                        <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName>.</p>
                <p>On this day Lili said: "Now I have made such progress that we can both go
                    home."</p>
                <p>"Home?" asked <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>.</p>
                <p>"I mean . . . Denmark, so that you may become free of a person who is long since
                    dead, from <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, and so that both of us,
                    you and I, can begin a new life."</p>

                <p>In the sleeping-car bound for Copenhagenâ€”<persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> was lying in slumber most peaceful and profoundâ€”<persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName> suddenly awoke from a terrible nightmare. She
                    did not know what she had dreamed, but it seemed to her as if she had been on
                    the point of suffocation. Cautiously she opened the window. The ferry was in the
                    midst of the sea. It was a grey, starless August night. And as she stared out,
                    she saw a picture in her mind's eye. The chief railway station of Copenhagen
                    full of people, and all crying out, "<persName key="courtaud">Lili
                        Elbe</persName>!" and pointing at her. And a nameless horror gripped her.
                    She could endure the sleeping-compartment no longer. She dressed, and in the
                    semi-darkness found her fur cloak, which had been given her ages ago, in the
                    early spring, in Berlin. She stole out of the car, and crept along the feebly
                    illuminated gangway, up the damp steps of the ferry, and on deck. Not a person
                    was to be seen; everybody was asleep. The only sound that could be heard was the
                    churning up of the water by the propeller. The mast lights were burning dim. The
                    funnels of the steamer were spurting black smoke. From the refreshment-rooms of
                    the ship came the reflection of electric light. A few passengers were sitting
                    there. She leaned over for fear of meeting familiar faces, of being recognized
                    by anybody here. Like one pursued</p>

                <p>she crept out of the beam of light into a dark comer.</p>
                <p>She shivered. "No, no," she moaned, "I cannot go to Copenhagen." And the vision
                    she had seen in the sleeping-car below would not leave her. Her imagination
                    painted the picture in colours ever more vivid, and eventually she kept hearing
                    out of the rhythm of the pounding ship's engines the cry: "There she is! There
                    she is! There she is! . . ."</p>
                <p>Suddenly she heard footsteps. She dared not look up. She crouched closer in her
                    corner. Like a black shadow she saw a man come striding by. His footsteps echoed
                    right across the deck, died away, and then came closer, and then quite near. The
                    man stopped just in front of her refuge, and struck a match in order to light a
                    cigarette. The flare of the match cast a lurid light over the man's face.
                    Involuntarily Lili had peered into the flame. She pressed both her hands before
                    her mouth so as not to cry out. As if in a fever the thought throbbed in her:
                    This man recognized you, and you know people. She shut her eyes; she seemed to
                    be imploring the grey heavens above: "Let me die." And now it was this shriek of
                    anguish which accompanied the rhythm of the engine like a perpetual cry: "Let me
                    die! Let me die! Let me die! . . .</p>
                <p>When at last the man had vanished, and she was again standing quite alone at
                    daybreak under the grey skyâ€”a metallic reflection of the rising sun percolating
                    through the dreary, leaden covering of cloudâ€”this cry of anguish kept forming
                    itself on her lips: "Let me die!" And, tired out, she dragged herself to the
                    railing, so utterly tired that she could</p>
                <p><num style="page">224</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>scarcely keep herself upright. She stared down at the dark sea, glittering here
                    and there, without hope, with unseeing eyes, too weak to resort to flightâ€”flight
                    from home, from herself, from nameless horror.</p>
                <p>Quietly she crept back into the sleeping-car. <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> was sleeping soundly and had noticed nothing. Nor would
                    she ever learn of the incident, Lili vowed. She undressed noiselessly, crept
                    back into her bed, and shed helpless tears. When <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> awoke, Lili had exhausted herself with crying, and her
                    face was rigid as a mask. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had to help
                    her dress. The lights of Copenhagen were already twinkling. <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> caressed her companion and spoke words of
                    consolation. Lili listened mutely and nodded, but could not get the nightmare
                    picture out of her head: the railway station with the thousand pointing fingers:
                    "There she is! There she is!"</p>
                <p>But nobody at the vast railway station called out her name. Nor was anybody there
                    to meet her. With her coat-collar turned up, and a thick veil round her hat,
                    Lili made her entrance into Copenhagen. Helpless as a child, she clung to
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> the short distance across the
                    platform and the flight of steps leading to the waiting-room. She dared not look
                    up; she trembled violently whenever she passed a group of people, like a person
                    who had committed a crime and thought she was being followed from all sides. The
                    waiting-room had only a few occupants, and they sat down in its extreme corner.
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had directed a porter to put
                    their luggage in the cloakroom. Then one of <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>'s cousins appeared. He was the only person whom</p>

                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had advised of their arrival. At
                    Lili's request it had been arranged that they should meet in the waiting-room.
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had hardly known this
                    cousinâ€”Lili was afraid of the curious eyes of this semi-strangerâ€”but the cousin
                    greeted them very simply.</p>
                <p>Believing that <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and Lili would proceed
                    at once to Lili's married sister, who lived in a suburb of Copenhagen, he had
                    not booked rooms for them. Now, however, Lili suddenly refused to go to her
                    sister. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had last seen her two years
                    before, and Lili had now neither the strength nor the courage to meet the sister
                    who was only a year older than <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>.</p>
                <p>"Very well," declared <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>; "then I will
                    see about an hotel," and went to the telephone. To every inquiry the same answer
                    was returned, We are full upâ€”no room available! It was August, and Copenhagen
                    was crowded with summer visitors. Lili lapsed into sheer despair. Eventually,
                    after a dozen refusals had been received, an hotel was found which offered a
                    little room on the top floor. A quarter of an hour later Lili was sitting in
                    this room. The whole day she did not venture to go out, but in the evening,
                    without asking <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> notified Lili's <persName
                        key="brotherChris">brother-in-law</persName> of their arrival.</p>
                <p>He came at once to the hotel and wanted to take Lili with him.</p>
                <p>"Give me just a few days longer. I must get used to the idea of seeing my sister
                    again. I have not the strength yet; I cannot see peopleâ€”least of all <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' family," implored <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, and all urging was in vain.</p>
                <p>"I am afraid," Lili kept stammering. "I am</p>
                <p><num style="page">226</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>so afraid of meeting again people who belonged to <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>, who loved <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>
                    and whom he loved. It seems as if I have murdered him. I know what I am saying
                    is absurd. But I feel as if I were proscribed or pursued. I would rather
                    die."</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> did not stir from Lili's bed that
                    first night in Copenhagen. It was an endless night, full of perplexity. Nothing
                    was left of the creature who had so confidently left the Women's Clinic. All
                    sangfroid and all hope had forsaken her. "I must go back to the hospital, where
                    I belong. There is no one elsewhere who loves me and takes me for what I am. I
                    must go back to the white sisters and to the other women in the park, for whom I
                    am no different from themselvesâ€”women who need help and are helped."</p>
                <p>But she was not yet allowed to return to Dresden. She was not allowed to stay in
                    the little room of the hotel. The next morning she was taken toâ€”Andreas'
                    sister.</p>

                <p>Many weeks later Lili recalled to herself her first encounter with <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' sister in the quiet villa by the
                    Gentofter Lake. She began to keep a diary, in order to render an account of her
                    activities and her new beginning of life. The first shocks of her week at
                    Copenhagen were a thing of the past. She had again found peace and even a
                    certain gaiety. She had even had strength to read through the notes which
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' friend in Berlin had made
                    rather less than six months before, at the time when <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> related the story of his life to his friend throughout a
                    night. Her sister's son, a young medical student, had encouraged her to start
                    making her own notes. "You would render a service," he said, "to yourself and
                    many other people if you would now record your thoughts and feelings, just at
                    this time when you want to prepare for serious creative work." Also the
                    Professor, her distant helper, had advised her to try to write down a record of
                    her life and experience.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was not living with her. She had taken
                    up quarters with acquaintances in the town, as nobody in Copenhagen was supposed
                    for the present to know of Lili's presence or even to be aware of her existence.
                    Consequently, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> told everybody who
                    asked after <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> that he lay seriously
                    ill in a German hospital . . . and she visited her</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>friends only now and then in secret. Nor would Lili have it otherwise. She hardly
                    dared do more herself than leave the garden in the evening, heavily veiled, with
                    her nephew, to take walks in the neighbourhood under his protection. So far her
                    sole occupation in Copenhagen had been to help <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> to regain her freedom. It was imperative to prevent the
                    least rumour becoming public, and to proceed with all possible discretion in the
                    effort to dissolve <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s marriage with
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. It was a difficult undertaking,
                    the outcome of which was by no means certain: no law as yet existed which could
                    be invoked to meet such a fantastic case. For as one of the spouses, <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, no longer existed, how then could a
                    marriage between a husband who no longer existed and his wife be dissolved? And
                    yet it was precisely to this "normal divorce law" which both the lawyers
                    instructed, and the body of judges to whom the case was assigned for settlement
                    appealed as the sole juridical criterion. This law required that for the period
                    of one year prior to divorce a separation should be enforced, and after the
                    expiration of this year a further year must elapse before the marriage could be
                    absolutely dissolved. In this way <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                    would lose two further years. Lili could not endure this thought. She would not
                    have <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> swindled out of two years of her
                    life. And as it seemed that the lawyers could find no other way out of the
                    difficulty, Lili contemplated the drastic step of liberating <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> from the burden of a marriage tie with one
                    who in the eyes of the law was a dead man by her own voluntary death. Then they
                    were assisted by a suggestion from an</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">229</num></p>
                <p>eminent lawyer that they should address a petition to the King, praying him to
                    declare invalid, by an act of grace, the marriage once contracted by <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>. The petition was delivered at the end of August, and by
                    the end of September <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and Lili were
                    summoned to appear personally at the hearing. When <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> inquired whether Lili was strong enough to accompany her
                    thence, she declared, beaming with joy: "If I can give you your freedom with so
                    little sacrifice, do you believe that I would think of myself even for a
                    moment?" And this journey to Court was the first common excursion which
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and Lili undertook. Two ladies
                    appeared before the judges. None but their two lawyers were present. The hearing
                    took place in strict secrecy. The whole proceedings lasted barely half an hour.
                    Lili shrank from describing them, even from recording them. Nor did <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> ever refer to them. And a few days later,
                    on the 6th October, they were apprised of the King's decree, which declared
                    invalid the marriage concluded between <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> and <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>.</p>
                <p>Shortly before this Lili had left her sister's villa and found a retreat in a
                    couple of attics in the house of an acquaintance.</p>
                <p>They were, indeed, very modest attics, in which she led her quiet life as long as
                    she stayed in Copenhagenâ€”as long, as she stayed in Denmark, and where she found
                    the necessary composure to put into practice the suggestion made by
                        <persName>the son of <persName><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>'
                            sister</persName></persName>: to begin her Copenhagen diary.</p>
                <p>On the 10th October she began. The first incident she recorded was her meeting
                    with <persName>Andreas' sister</persName></p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>"When on the second day of my stay in Copenhagen I went out to see
                        <persName>Andreas' sister</persName>â€”now I know and feel that I may also
                    call her my sisterâ€”I entered a room which I did not know, but in which <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had often been before. When I opened the
                    door no one was in the room, and when I took the first step I saw my reflection
                    in a mirror on the wall: a big, elegant woman with smiling eyes, with rouged
                    lips, with fresh cheeks, was staring at me. I was satisfied with my reflection.
                    I knew that I had done everything to make myself as handsome as possible. In my
                    own justification. Who could reproach me for resorting to all the beautifying
                    arts to which every woman has a claim. If I should ever paint myself, I would
                    like to retain this moment on canvas. Scarcely had I regarded my own person than
                    I saw behind me another picture, enclosed by the same mirror. A large fjord
                    landscape bathed in sunlight with luxuriant vegetation on both banks. My heart
                    stopped beating. I turned round; I stared at the landscape in the heavy gilt
                    frame on the wall. It was a picture which the young <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> had painted of his home. I looked round the room to see
                    if anybody was observing me. I saw on all walls of the room pictures of
                    landscapes, towns, streams. I recognized them all as <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' pictures. I saw all his travels before me. There was
                    the <placeName>town in Southern France on the Loire</placeName>, where <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> had spent many joyous summer months. And not only
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>! No, I, <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>, had also lived down there, like a prisoner escaped from

                <p>of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' body. There was the bridge over
                    the Seine in Paris under the threatening sky. <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> had stood on this bridge . . . had peered down at the
                    river and wrestled with thoughts of death. And pictures by <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> hung beside them. One of them showed me
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, enticed out of <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, in woman's clothes. I approached the
                    picture and could not help stroking it, while tears ran down my cheeks. And I
                    sat down on a chair in front of the table. A big album was lying there.
                    Involuntarily I opened it and turned over the pages. I found the pictures of a
                    fair boy with large blue eyes . . . pictures of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> when he was still a child, innocently happy with his two
                        <persName key="brotherPlur">brothers</persName> and <persName>his
                        sister</persName>.</p>
                <p>"Then the door opened and a lady with dark hair and blue eyes and trembling arms
                    entered the room: <persName>Andreas' sister</persName>. I rose to my feet and
                    stood in front of her. And my sister had to look up to me, for I was bigger than
                    she. Then an absurd recollection flashed through me: <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> and <persName>his sister</persName> had been the same
                    size. From my sister's eyes I saw that she was thinking the same thing, and did
                    not know what to make of the idea. I said to her: 'Good day . . be kind to your
                    sister <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>.'</p>
                <p>"Perhaps I should have said something altogether different. I might have said:
                    'Be kind to me and love me as you loved <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>.' Perhaps I might have said nothing at all. Or perhaps I
                    might have only smiled and said to her: 'Do not be surprised because I am bigger
                    than our dead brother <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, for I wear
                    ever so high heels. And don't take this amiss, because</p>
                <p><num style="page">232</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>I want to be as pretty and ladylike as all other well-groomed women.'</p>
                <p>"Then we sat together on the sofa and in front of us lying on the table was the
                    album with the portraits of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> as a
                    child. For a long time we held hands. And my sister was kind; she sought for
                    words. Her eyes looked at me, her lips said something. And I did not know
                    whether it was her lips or her eyes which spoke to me: 'Don't be angry with me
                    if I cannot yet properly call you by your name of Lili . . . if I cannot yet
                    arrange my ideas about you . . . if I only seek for <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> when I look at you, in your eyes, at your mouth, at your
                    hands, and at your forehead. For I loved <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' eyes and his forehead so much. I kissed his forehead so
                    often. You know that, or don't you know it? But <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> knew it. For I am only a year older than <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. And when <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> and I were quite small, he five and I six years old, I
                    was his little mother. There was never a prettier, sweeter brother than he. He
                    played with my dolls, he pushed my doll's pram. And I called him
                    "Lilleman"â€”little man. Once when I wrote down the name for Mother and Mother
                    told me that I had spelt "Lilleman" with only one "n" instead of two, I said
                    that my brudderkins <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was only a
                    "Lilleman" with one "n", for he was not a proper man at all. Mother smiled, and
                    you too smiled when you heard itâ€”no . . . not you . . . <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> smiled. He did not know, perhaps, why he laughed. And I
                    did not know why I had said that my <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>
                    was not a proper man at all. And do you still</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">233</num></p>
                <p>remember how we used to push our doll's pram in the woods? <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was so fond of pushing the little pram.
                    But he was afraid that others would see him and chaff him about it. And do you
                    remember how I would then place my hands over <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' little white hands? And do you know why I did that?
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> never knew why, but I can tell
                    you now. I did it only in order that if we were surprised by anybody, I alone
                    could continue pushing the pram, while <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> could quickly remove his hands from the handle, as if
                    nothing had happened.' And if my sister did not say this with her lips, she said
                    it with her eyes. But it was no doubt her lips. I only nodded, and kept nodding.
                    I did not weep. I took it quite calmly that for many, many days long she was
                    seeking in me with her large, troubled, woman's eyes only the picture of
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, her little brother, and, as I
                    now believe, found it. Sometimes, in the first days, when we conversed with each
                    other frequently with very painful feelings for many hours, she addressed me as
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. I felt then as if I ought to
                    die. Nor could I conceal this from her. And then I would implore her to believe
                    me that I was not <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' murderer, that if
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had not died, I should have had
                    to go under with him, and that if I was living now, I owed him every day of my
                    life. Once I said that I really had neither parents nor brothers and sisters, as
                    I was born not up here in the North, but down in Germany. And perhaps if mother
                    had bore me as a girl, she would not have loved me so much as she loved
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. It was probably on this</p>
                <p><num style="page">234</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>day that my sister said to me that everything that had happened in Dresden was an
                    outrage against Nature; had been a gamble with Fate; questioning whether
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> could not really have survived;
                    or whether it would not have been far better for <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> to have borne his heavy fate and his tortured body to
                    the bitter end. Then she showed me all the works which she had collected of
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, and I perceived that her whole
                    home was really a museum for <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, for
                    all the walls of her room were crowded with <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' pictures. 'Don't you see,' said my sister, 'what an
                    artist we have lost in himâ€”how different he was from you?' 'Yes,' I said; 'that
                    only goes to prove how right <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was to
                    release me, for we were two beings, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>
                    and I. I know that as a person I am far inferior to him, that I shall never be
                    able to achieve what he achieved, that I shall never be able to paint . . . that
                    I don't even want to paint. For if I did so I could never approach his standard.
                    But just because of this you can see that the beings who inhabited the body
                    which Mother bore were really two beings. I have exchanged so much for this life
                    which I must now live alone, as you yourself say that <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> was so much stronger and more capable than I. He lived
                    and worked during a long life, and I dare hardly show myself. And if I show
                    myself, you all call me a joke, a deception, a masquerade. Let us, I beg you, be
                    friends and good sisters for the sake of our dead brother <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>.' </p>
                <p>"Then there was the day on which she said: '<persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>, perhaps no wrong has been done. It was</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">235</num></p>
                <p>certainly the will of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> that everything
                    should happen as it ought to happen. He was always chivalrous. And hence he
                    released you, and withdrew his life for yours.'</p>
                <p>"It was a terribly hard contest between my sister and me for my recognition as a
                    person, as a sister. And I know how unspeakably hard she found it to believe in
                    me as her sister Lili and to receive me, though it were only out of compassion.
                    I did not make it easy for her, for whenever I showed myself, by my character
                    and by the way in which I spoke, in which I moved, in which I thought, I veiled
                    completely the character of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. He was
                    ingenious, sagacious, and interested in everythingâ€”a reflective and thoughtful
                    man. And I was quite superficial. Deliberately so. For I had to demonstrate
                    every day that I was a different creature from him, that I was a woman. A
                    thoughtless, flighty, very superficially minded woman, fond of dress and fond of
                    enjoyment, yes, I believe even childish. And I can say it calmly now: all this
                    was certainly not merely farcical acting. It was really my character,
                    untroubled, carefree, illogical, capricious.</p>
                <p>"During the weeks I spent in my sister's house I could not overcome my shyness of
                    people and the melancholy which oppressed me so here in Copenhagen. For I
                    noticed, when I regarded myself of an evening alone in my bedroom, I would look
                    tired, done up, and impossible. And I felt that everybody in Copenhagen, even my
                    family, regarded me as a phenomenon. To be sure, people gradually got used to
                    me,</p>
                <p><num style="page">236</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>were kind to me, and let me have my own way. They tried to persuade me that I
                    need have no fear about my appearance, as I looked like every other woman.
                    Nevertheless, I was assailed by a deadly fear if I left the garden with my
                    sister's son for a short walk. The tiniest smudge on the face intimidated me at
                    that time so much that I would only sally forth with him heavily veiled. I felt
                    like a pariah. Other women could be ugly, could commit every possible crime. I,
                    however, must be beautiful, must be immaculate, else I lost every right to be a
                    woman. Else I should have dishonoured him who had created me, Werner Kreutz.
                    There were days on which I did not want to leave my room, when I felt pursued by
                    everybody in Copenhagen. All the feeling of security and freedom which had been
                    mine in the clinic in Dresden and also in Berlin completely left me here. And it
                    was so difficult to write to the Professor. However much I wanted to, I could
                    not bring myself to write him, as he would only see in me a despondent,
                    helpless, hopeless person."</p>
                <p>From the day on which Lili rented her attic in the town, her courage began to
                    rise again. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was free, and could begin
                    a new life. Lili was the first to telegraph this glad news to <persName
                        key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName>, their friend in Italy. And it was
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, too, who urged <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> to journey south to join their friend as
                    quickly as she could. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> smiled. She
                    knew Lili better; she knew that Lili still needed her here. For Lili would have
                    to mix with people and eventually overcome her timidity in the world. So
                    very</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">237</num></p>
                <p>gradually <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> initiated her most intimate
                    friends into the secret of Lili's existence, brought Lili into contact with
                    them, until Lili felt sufficiently tranquil to take her first walk through the
                    streets of Copenhagen. Nobody recognized her. She even ventured with a number of
                    friends, who immediately accepted her for what she was, as a woman, into cafÃ©s
                    and restaurants. She went alone into shops to make purchases, and eventually
                    visited a hairdresser's. And when her friend Inger arrived one day from Berlin,
                    Lili seemed to have quite overcome the serious emotional crisis through which
                    she had been obliged to pass in Copenhagen. Inger, who had not seen Lili since
                    the first operation in Berlin, was delighted at her friend's appearance. They
                    spent a few carefree, joyous, undisturbed days with each other. They shopped
                    together, visited dressmakers, went on walks and excursions, and finally
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> even ventured with her friend along
                    the "Strog", Copenhagen's Oxford Street. No, she need no longer have any fear;
                    nobody saw anything unusual in her; her anonymity in Copenhagen seemed to be
                    secured from all dangers. When, therefore, strolling arm-in-arm with Inger along
                    the Rathausplatz she saw two of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>'
                    studio comrades approaching, without being recognized by them, and when she
                    heard one whispering to the other: "By Jove, what a fine pair of legs!" meaning
                    Lili's legs, she swallowed the remark with avidity, not only as a compliment,
                    but as a hundred per cent recognition of her identity as a woman.</p>
                <p>Only one thing troubled her rather more than she liked In contrast to <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s and <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>'</p>
                <p><num style="page">238</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>women friends, who had long since accepted Lili as one of themselves, with few
                    exceptions, all the male friends of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>
                    avoided <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>, who had expected help and sympathy for Lili from them
                    most of all, and in this belief had revealed Lili's existence to them, was very
                    distressed over this failure on the part of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' friends, all the more so as just at that time the whole
                    secret of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and Lili was divulged in
                    Copenhagen through the indiscretion of a Parisian woman friend and eventually
                    published in unreserved fashion by an organ of the Press. Lili learned of this
                    by accident. All her gaiety vanished again. For many days she would not stir out
                    of her attic. She paid no heed to anything, and could not understand why none of
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' friends found their way to her.
                    A little entry in her diary tells of this:</p>
                <p>"How is it possible that all <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' friends
                    here have left me in the lurch? That they all avoid me as if I were a pariah?
                    What have I done to them? <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was always
                    ready to help them. He was always a reliable friend. And now one of them says
                    that just because he esteemed <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> so
                    highly he could never recognize <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. Lili
                    would always stand between him and <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>.
                    He would shudder at offering her his hand. This sentiment is nothing but an
                    eruption of overweening masculinity. And another excuses himself with other
                    subterfuges. One could not be seen walking with Lili in the streets without
                    compromising himself. Copenhagen was too small to show oneself publicly with
                    such a pitiful creature, unmolested and unsuspected."</p>

                <p>Lili herself never read the lurid article which a sensational journalist had
                    published concerning <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and her, but
                    the appearance of this article sufficed to clinch her determination to leave
                    Copenhagen as quickly as possible. Now she knew that in Copenhagen she was
                    outlawed. And panic-stricken she left the city. She would have preferred to
                    return to Germany immediately; but one of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' <persName key="brotherPlur">brothers</persName> in
                    Veijle, their native place in Jutland, implored her to visit him, if only for a
                    few days. He was ready to accept and cherish her as a sister, and assured her
                    that she could always find a home and peace and quiet with him. Lili went to
                    him. She carried out this resolve as if in a dream. "Yes, go," her sister and
                    everybody who had Lili's good at heart had said, "go back again to our little
                    home town. Perhaps you will there recover your equilibrium. And if later on you
                    should want to return to your helper in Germany, then do so. But first recover
                    your gaiety and yourself."</p>
                <p>A few days before this <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had left for
                    the Southâ€”for Italy.</p>

                <p>Lili's brother and sister-in-law inhabited a villa facing a little fjord town in
                    Jutland. Here she could live undisturbed by curious glances.</p>
                <p>She was received most cordially, especially by her sister-in-law, a dear good
                    creature who as a woman showed Lili not only sympathy, but profound
                    understanding from the first moment.</p>
                <p>The brother did not find it easy the first few days to adjust himself to his new
                    sister, but it was not long before he was quite at home with her and could
                    regard Lili simply as a sister.</p>
                <p><persName>Brother</persName> and <persName>sister-in-law</persName> vied with
                    each other to give Lili a peaceful and happy time during her stay in <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' home town.</p>
                <p>She was quite content to be treated as a child who had been ill and must now be
                    cherished and cosseted. Every evening her sister-in-law sat beside Lili's bed
                    and held her hand until she fell asleep. She was never left alone the whole day.
                    If she went out, someone went with her. If Lili protested, they would hardly let
                    her speak: even in little towns there were wicked people, and mad dogs, or other
                    dangers. . . .</p>
                <p>In these quiet and safe surroundings her nerves got better. She took long walks

                <p>forests which were now glorious in their autumn colours.</p>
                <p>Here by the fjord and in the adjacent woods <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> had passed the happiest days of his childhood. But
                    nearly all recollections of this had been extinguished in <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. Everything seemed new to her, as if she saw
                    it for the first time. Only now and then, in a particular light, prompted by a
                    sound or a scent, would a far-off memory be kindled in her, as if through a
                    haze. But it was never anything exact that stirred in her.</p>
                <p>One day her brother went with her into the town, to show her the old parental
                    house in which <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had been born and
                    nurtured and their parents had lived until their death.</p>
                <p>Lili stood in front of the old house of her parents; she recognized it, remotely
                    and hazily, like something of which one had once dreamed. Her brother frequently
                    asked her if she could not remember this or that incident from common childhood.
                    The brother was only a few years older than <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>. And it had always been <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> who had remembered all the incidents of the past more
                    clearly than anyone else. But Lili was always obliged to answer in the negative,
                    however hard she tried to conjure up pictures from <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' past. She always had such a strange feeling, as if
                    something were vibrating in the depths of her being. But she was still too weak
                    to form a precise idea of what it was. Frequently these questions tortured her,
                    and her brother felt it and desisted.</p>
                <p>It was not through the past that she felt herself linked to her brother and
                    sister-in-law: but both</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>were so kind and considerate that she gradually felt quite at home with them.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>," her brother said one day, "you have
                    now been here almost a whole month and you have not yet visited <persName
                        key="father">Father</persName>'s and Mother's grave in the old
                    churchyard."</p>
                <p>"I should so much like to go there," she answered, "but you must show me where
                    they are buried." Then she burst into tears.</p>
                <p>Her brother regarded her with surprise. He took her hands and drew her to him
                    protectively.</p>
                <p>Lili divined what he was thinking.</p>
                <p>"Yes," she said, tormented by a secret fear, "I know I have had neither father
                    nor mother. I am really quite alone in the world, and often think that life is
                    too full of dangers to be able to master it alone. Just for me. You must
                    understand that. My life began amidst terrible pain, and sometimes I fear that
                    everything has been in vain. But then again it seems as if something great and
                    strong has sustained me. Then I feel something precious stirring within me. It
                    may be happiness. In my dreams this happiness is perfect."</p>
                <p>Her brother gazed at her with inquiring eyes. Lili patted his shoulder. "Dear
                    brother, perhaps you cannot understand me when I talk like that; but that does
                    not matter, sy long as you are kind to me. Often I do not understand it myself;
                    I do not understand my own life; I can never get over my astonishment."</p>

                <p><num style="page">243</num></p>
                <p>Lili was again living in her Copenhagen attic.</p>
                <p>Here she was introduced by her hostess to a young Norwegian veterinary surgeon,
                    who, without knowing what had happened to her, told her that he had been
                    experimenting for a long time with the transplantation and grafting of ovaries
                    upon animals and explained how the effect of these new ovaries was so great as
                    to change completely the animal's character and determined its age. And inasmuch
                    as animals were less valuable subjects than human beings, he had more
                    opportunity as a veterinary surgeon to study this phenomenon by experiments than
                    other doctors. It went without saying that similar processes would be observed
                    in the case of human beings.</p>
                <p>Lili now realized that the crisis through which she had passed, especially when
                    she was first in Denmark, and from the effects of which she was still suffering,
                    was a natural consequence of the implantation which had been carried out upon
                    her. She perceived how her whole cerebral function had received a new
                    direction.</p>
                <p>She confided all this to her diary:</p>
                <p>"In the first months after my operation it was necessary above all else to
                    recuperate. When this had happened to some extent, the physical change in me
                    began. My breasts formed, my hips changed and became softer and rounder. And at
                    the same time other forces began to stir in my brain and to choke whatever
                    remnants of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> still remained there. A
                    new emotional life was arising within me."</p>
                <p><num style="page">244</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>At that time she wrote a letter to Werner Kreutz:</p>
                <p>"I feel so changed that it seems as if you had operated not upon my body, but
                    upon my brain. And although my face still bears traces of what I have gone
                    through, I feel I am getting younger and younger every day.</p>
                <p>"Even the name of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName> has no
                    longer a bitter sound for me. He first had his youth, but now I believe that I
                    am going to have mine. And sometimes I find it is unjust for me to retain his
                    age and birthday, for my biological age is quite different from his. And it is
                    also painful for me that his name instead of my name is on the official records.
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and I have really nothing
                    whatever to do with each other.</p>
                <p>"I have now been a few weeks in his birthplace, but I have felt like a stranger
                    there all the time. Nothing of what is now stirring in me was born in his
                    parents' house. I am newly created. I was born under your auspices in Dresden,
                    and my birthday is that April day on which you operated upon me. My temperament,
                    too, is like April weather. I laugh and cry at the same time. My heart is full
                    of expectation as a spring day. And every time I feel stirring within me this
                    new life and this new youth, as if I were mother and child at the same time,
                    then all my thoughts turn towards you in boundless gratitude."</p>
                <p>A few days later Lili filled many pages in her diary:</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">245</num></p>
                <p>"I know that only doctors can understand me when I speak of the question of my
                    age. And a number of doctors have even promised to help me if I should later
                    attempt to cut loose from <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> in this
                    respect, so that I am given an age that corresponds to my physical development
                    as a woman. Others may ridicule this question or regard it with indifference;
                    the important thing, in their view, is that one feels young and gives a youthful
                    impression. I, on the other hand, believe just the contraryâ€”that one is, in
                    fact, actually as old as the official papers state, whether one feels young or
                    old. Yesterday I discussed this question with a friend, who is a lawyer, and
                    said to him:</p>
                <p>"'Don't forget: every time one books a room in an hotel, fills up a census paper,
                    applies for a situation, or marries, one must always answer questions about
                    age.'</p>
                <p>"And what did he say? He replied that I must not be so immodest. I must take over
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' age as a heritage, just as I
                    have inherited all his rights. Which I vigorously contested. 'Assume, for the
                    sake of argument,' I said, 'that I have some talent for painting and now began
                    to paint like him. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had his contacts
                    as painter. He had exhibited in a number of salons in Paris and elsewhere, and
                    was a member of several of them. Can you imagine my running to the various
                    exhibitions committees who knew him and there telling my fantastic story to the
                    best of my ability, in order to claim whatever rights <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> had? Both the French and the Danish colleagues of</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>Andreas would regard me as crazy if I should maintain that I was one and the same
                    person as <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. At least I should be
                    regarded as an improbable phenomenon and ridiculed accordingly.</p>
                <p>"No, if I should really paint I would have to build up my career right from the
                    start, as otherwise I should make myself a laughingstock.</p>
                <p>"And can you see meâ€”<persName key="courtaud">Lili Elbe</persName>â€”claiming the
                    distinction which <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName> received
                    from the French state as a painter? Can you imagine me decorating myself with
                    it? No, I revere the memory of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> too
                    much for this.</p>
                <p>"I know very well that I am only a stupid female and a mere nobody.</p>
                <p>"And, moreover, I am well aware that when one inherits, it always means that one
                    enters upon the heritage with all its assets and liabilities, and for this
                    reason one can even refuse to accept an inheritance. I lay no claim to <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' heritage, least of all to his birthday,
                    for his birthday signifies for me nothing but a liability. I cannot be forcibly
                    compelled to take over this heritage. I will not drag <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' age along with me like a burden, as I fear that just
                    this very circumstance might be disastrous for my future. You have only to look
                    at me to see that I lack all the assurance which <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> possessed. My next-of-kin, that is, <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' relatives, tell me every day how
                    altogether different I am in character from <persName key="sparreAn"

                <p>storms. I feel like a young ingrafted tree which can be uprooted with the first
                    gust of wind.</p>
                <p>"I must now try to devise a livelihood, to undertake something, to earn money for
                    my support. And this is just where age comes in. Once a person secures a
                    position, then it all depends upon how one feels and how one carries out the
                    duties attaching to such position; but if a person has to begin right at the
                    beginning, then everybody asks, especially if the subject be a woman, how old
                    she is. And almost everywhere young people are preferred because it is thought
                    that the future is theirs and that they possess possibilities of development.
                    This applies not only to artists, but to all vocations.</p>
                <p>"I admit that my case is absolutely unusual, unique. But cannot you understand
                    how wrong it is to insert my name instead of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' name on the baptismal certificate? My name, <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili Elbe</persName>, whom neither <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' <persName key="father">father</persName> nor mother
                    knew. And now, legally speaking, it is really as if <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> had never existed.</p>
                <p>"But that is, of course, nonsense, sheer nonsense, as a large number of paintings
                    bear the name of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. You can find his
                    pictures in many galleries and art collections here. <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> published books which bear his name. Consequently, I
                    think it was wrong simply to cross his name out of the register and to insert
                    mine in its place."</p>
                <p>"And what did the lawyer answer?</p>
                <p>"In that case I must regard the name of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>, to some extent, as my pseudonym.</p>
                <p>"'No,' I retorted, 'that would be wrong,</p>

                    >Andreas</persName>' pictures. They were created by <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>. And it is just his pictures that are his absolute
                    property. As a painter he was no dual personality. When he painted, he was an
                    entire man, and strangely enough, until his last breath.'</p>
                <p>"My friend then inquired whether I had never felt any desire to paint like
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, whose art had been the most
                    characteristic thing about him.</p>
                <p>"'No,' I replied, 'I have not the slightest desire to paint. Not because I still
                    feel too weak and tired. No; but it grows more apparent to me every day how
                    little, in contrast with him, I see with a painter's eyes. I have no desire to
                    continue his work. My life must go its own way. I do not mean by this that I am
                    no artist. Perhaps I am an artist. Anyhow, I believe most emphatically that I
                    shall find another outlet for my artistic impulses, that is, for the desire to
                    shape something. But I cannot say anything definite about this now, as I am
                    still quite in the dark.'</p>
                <p>"We were strolling through the grounds of Bernstorff Castle. It was a dreary
                    December day, and my friend asked me whether I had lost all that feeling for
                    Nature which inspired <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>.</p>
                <p>"'No,' I said; 'only whatever I look at now no longer suggests a subject for a
                    picture. I am not "possessed" by a landscape, by a mood of Nature. If I see
                    anything really beautiful, I feel as if my subconscious mind were absorbing it.
                    More than this I do not know. Perhaps one</p>

                <p><num style="page">249</num></p>
                <p>day I shall be able to give a visible-audible expression to all this, in some
                    artistic form, whether it be painting, or music, or prose, or something else. At
                    the moment I find my greatest release in music. But when I grow introspective I
                    seem to myself to be like a boat with all sails spread which drifts at the mercy
                    of every current of the wind. For, indeed, I am still so very new. I must first
                    have time to find myself. How old am I in reality? Perhaps the doctors can say.
                    My age has nothing whatever to do with the age of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>, as I did not share flesh and blood with <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> from the beginning. It was <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> who possessed supremacy over this body for
                    almost a lifetime. And it was only later that I developed in our common body, so
                    that this body evolved until there was no longer any room for <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>.'</p>
                <p>"However puzzling all this may sound to others, this is exactly how the matter
                    stands, and, for this reason, I think that the name of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> ought to remain in the register of the church where he
                    was baptised, and that papers ought to be issued for me, who has no home and no
                    country, giving my biological age.'</p>
                <p>"My friend parted from me, shaking his head. And this head-shaking was what I
                    encountered from most people.</p>

                <p>The many weeks which Lili now passed in her attic, far from <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, were weeks of recuperation.</p>
                <p>It was her short life which, looking round and looking back, she confided to the
                    pages of her diary. Since the journey from Berlin to Dresden everything had come
                    back to her again, vividly illuminated by a remarkable light which cast no
                    shadows.</p>
                <p>It was a confession which she poured out without restraint and without mercy on
                    herself.</p>
                <p>"I feel like a bridge-builder. But it is a strange bridge that I am building, I
                    stand on one of the banks, which is the present day. There I have driven in the
                    first pile. And I must build it clear across to the other bank, which often I
                    cannot see at all and sometimes only vaguely, and now and then in a dream. And
                    then I often do not know whether the other bank is the past or the future.
                    Frequently the question plagues me: Have I had only a past, or have I had no
                    past at all? Or have I only a future without a past?</p>
                <p>"I have found a new friend who wants to help me to collect and collate the loose
                    leaves of my confession. Many years ago he knew <persName key="sparreAn"

                <p>slightly. He can hardly recall him now. He can remember his eyes, and in my eyes
                    he has found this recollection. He is a German, and I am glad of the chance of
                    talking German with him here.</p>
                <p>"He told me that when I went to see him for the first time, before I entered the
                    room, he felt somewhat afraid of me, as if he might perhaps feel a repugnance
                    towards me, especially as shortly before he had again glanced at some
                    photographs of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. When I was in his
                    presence, so he told me, every doubt was dissipated, every doubt of my proper
                    existence. He only saw the woman in me, and when he thought of <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, or spoke to me about <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, he saw and felt a person beside me or
                    behind me.</p>
                <p>"He gave me a new German translation of the Bible. The first volume. <hi
                        rend="italic">The Book of the Beginning</hi>, was the title, and I read in
                    it many times the words:</p>
                <p>"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the
                    deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</p>
                <p>"Is it presumptuous of me, whenever I think of my beginning, always to hear these
                    words, the music of this verse, sounding in my ears?</p>
                <p>. . . . .</p>
                <p>"I often give the loose leaves of my diary to my German friend to read. I ask him
                    to tell me whenever I am obscure, and then a word from him encourages me to
                    proceed. He understands my strange feeling about building this bridge in the

                    I am not nervous any more. No one takes any notice of me in the streets.</p>
                <p>"We talked through many long nights. We talked nearly always of the life that was
                    now coming for her and for me. She was also able to help me out of the
                    difficulties which I encountered so often when writing down my confessions. She
                    always knew the answer.</p>
                <p>"She talked a lot about <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName>. They wanted
                    to marry without delay, and <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> said that
                    her home would then always be my home. <persName key="feruzziRi"
                        >Feruzzi</persName> knew everything and said that he would always be my
                    friend and protector. And <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> declared
                    that we were so closely bound together that she could not imagine herself away
                    from me for long.</p>
                <p>"She kept speaking to me in this strain. Then she would say laughingly that I was
                    not only her sister, but also her big grown-up daughter. I had to promise her
                    that I would go to her and <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName> soon
                    after their marriage. <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName>, too, would
                    welcome me like a grown-up daughter. How happy these words made me!"</p>
                <p>A well-known Copenhagen art dealer, who was an old friend of <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> and one of the few who had welcomed <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, suggested that he should arrange an
                    exhibition of the pictures which <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had
                    left.</p>
                <p>With the assistance of <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> he brought

                <p>whole collection of forty pictures from Paris to Copenhagen, and also many of
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s pictures.</p>
                <p>But <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, who had arranged the exhibition
                    together with <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, was advised in no
                    circumstances to show herself at the opening of the exhibition. The strictest
                    secrecy was observed towards the newspapers as to the character of the
                    exhibition. To avoid gossip, it was given out that the main object of the
                    exhibition was to raise funds, through the sale of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' latest pictures, to defray the cost of his long illness
                    in a German hospital.</p>
                <p>Invitations were despatched to the opening of the exhibition.</p>
                <p>This exhibition was not calculated to excite surprise, as <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> had exhibited in Copenhagen nearly every year, and, in
                    fact, in the salons of this friendly art dealer.</p>
                <p>On this occasion a strange feeling of suppressed curiosity pervaded the
                    atmosphere on the opening day. The most intimate friends of the artist were, of
                    course, initiated into the secret. But many others, who also made their
                    appearance on this occasion, had heard of the rumours that had long been current
                    in Copenhagen. And all these rumours, however frequently they had been
                    contradicted, cropped up again phantom-like. Nobody ventured to buy a single
                    picture.</p>
                <p>Lili's resources melted away. She was depressed at the thought that she might be
                    compelled to accept assistance from her relatives, however gladly they would
                    have offered it to her. A suggestion was made that she should consent to the
                    publication of the autobiographical sketches, her</p>
                <p><num style="page">254</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>"life's confession", which she had not yet completed; but she rejected this
                    proposal with something like horror.</p>
                <p>An acquaintance then hit upon the absurd idea that Lili should impersonate
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and give the lie to all the
                    rumours by making her appearance at the exhibition in this manner.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was no less horrified at this idea
                    than <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. Then a friend who was on the
                    staff of a leading Copenhagen newspaper came to Lili's assistance.</p>
                <p>She had long been wanting to write a descriptive article dealing with Lili's
                    metamorphosis. Lili had hitherto vetoed the suggestion. But now, the friend
                    explained, the time had arrived when the public ought to learn the real truth.
                    Such a well-known artist as <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> simply
                    could not just disappear. Consequently, it was only natural that the most
                    fantastic rumours should be circulating in Copenhagen, especially as <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had so mysteriously disappeared from
                    existence for nearly a year. And now she was resolved to relate in her newspaper
                    the manner in which a gifted German surgeon had transformed the mortally ill
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName> into a glowing young
                    woman, into <persName key="courtaud">Lili Elbe</persName>. The achievement of
                    the German surgeon must be broadcasted to the world. It must not be allowed to
                    remain a secret. It must be divulged one day, and now was the appropriate
                    time.</p>
                <p>With a heavy heart, persuaded by <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and
                    all her friends, Lili at length consented.</p>
                <p>The next day, the beginning of March 1931, the article appeared and cleared the
                    Copenhagen</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">255</num></p>
                <p>atmosphere. Like lightning the news flashed through the world press. Everywhere
                    in Europe and America this extraordinary human fate was discussed. But despite
                    the fact that Lili had now become a world celebrity, and the newspapers in all
                    languages broadcasted her portrait everywhere, she went about Copenhagen more
                    peaceably than ever. Her constant fear, that people would shout her name after
                    her in the street, did not materialize.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the few who knew her, no one imagined for an instant that
                    the young lady who strolled almost daily along the "StrÃ¶g", and differed in no
                    respect from other ladies, was the legendary <persName key="courtaud">Lili
                        Elbe</persName>. A few days after the publication of the first article about
                    her, she happened to be standing among a group of people in front of the
                    entrance of a publishing house, where an illustrated article about her had just
                    appeared in a weekly magazine, in order to buy a copy of this periodical. Then
                    she sat down in a tram and read her own story just like many of the others who
                    were sitting in the car. Nobody took any notice of her, although she was wearing
                    the same coat and the same hat as in the photographs which illustrated the
                    article.</p>
                <p>After this "success" she was quite reassured and henceforth had various amusing
                    experiences.</p>
                <p>She went daily to <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' exhibition, which
                    was now thronged by people who hoped to catch a glimpse of <persName

                    without a single one of the visitors having recognized her.</p>
                <p>Once an old lady even came up to her and whispered: "Tell me, miss, don't you
                    think that</p>
                <p><num style="page">256</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>the lady over there with the large feet and the necktie, who looks like a man, is
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili Elbe</persName>?"</p>
                <p>"Yes," answered <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, "most decidedly that is
                    she."</p>
                <p>Another day, when she was sitting in a manicure saloon, a Swedish lady entered
                    and exclaimed:</p>
                <p>"Have you heard the story of <persName key="courtaud">Lili Elbe</persName>? Do
                    you really believe there is anything in it?"</p>
                <p>Everybody in the saloon explained that however fantastic it all sounded, it was
                    perfectly true. Only <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, who had for weeks
                    been one of the regular attendants at the saloon, played the part of the
                    sceptic.</p>
                <p>"This article is, of course, exaggerated," she observed dryly. Whereupon all the
                    ladies agreed that all newspapers exaggerated something terribly</p>
                <p>. . . . .</p>
                <p>Lili's state of health improved considerably. Her nerves were soothed. Now she
                    need no longer hide herself from people.</p>
                <p>Her legitimation papers were now in order. By royal sanction she was permitted to
                    use her name without challenge. The exhibition had been a success, and she
                    herself received many proofs of sympathy, especially from women. Women whom she
                    did not know in the least sent her letters full of comprehension and enthusiasm.
                    Flowers were sent her by unknown admirers. Various doctors offered to attend her
                    without payment so long as she remained in Copenhagen and to supervise her state
                    of health.</p>
                <p>"People are making me a heroine," she said</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">257</num></p>
                <p>to her friends. She breathed again and began to enjoy life.</p>
                <p>. . . . .</p>
                <p>And a few weeks later <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> could again
                    leave for the South with an easy conscience, to celebrate her marriage with

                <p>During these short weeks which she spent with <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> in Copenhagen, Lili knew for the first time what it was
                    like to be in the company of a happy woman who was in love.</p>
                <p>And now, when <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had left her alone,
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName> felt a secret sorrow, a restrained
                    grief, almost a feeling of envyâ€”but no, it could not be envy, for she knew that
                    no one more deeply wished <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> to be happy
                    than she.</p>
                <p>At length it dawned upon her that what was affecting her so painfully was a void
                    in her life, something unfulfilled that in all probability never could be
                    fulfilled.</p>
                <p>All this she felt vaguely, and yet she feared to give a name to this new thing
                    that was stirring within her.</p>
                <p>Spring was now advancing. The garden of the house in which her attic was situated
                    was quivering with tender green: Lili felt her body thriving. But she also felt
                    how this mysterious craving within her for something to which she could give no
                    name became ever more clamant and insistent.</p>
                <p>She began to work more and more strenuously, as if she had no time to lose. All
                    through the night she would fill pages as she wrote down her confessions. She
                    allowed herself only a few hours'</p>

                <p>sleep. In the daytime she would sit at the piano and play for hours. Then she
                    would sit sewing new clothes, or lend a hand with the work of the house. Her
                    evenings she spent with relatives and friends. She often visited her German
                    friend, taking to him fresh sheets of her manuscript, although she felt
                    increasingly reluctant to discuss with him what she had written.</p>
                <p>"Put it all in order," she would often say, "and do not read it until I have left
                    Copenhagen."</p>
                <p>She had arranged with <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> that when the
                    summer came she would join her and <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName>
                    in the South.</p>
                <p>. . . .</p>
                <p>"The doctor whom I regularly visit said to me to-day: 'When I saw you first, I
                    thought you were a pitiful, degenerate, unfortunate creature, but now that I
                    have been able to observe you quietly I can see that you are a healthy and
                    vigorous woman.'</p>
                <p>"I cannot tell you how happy these words made me.</p>
                <p>"In the evening I told my German friend what the doctor said, and the former
                    observed: </p>
                <p>"Now it will soon be time for you to paint again.'</p>
                <p>"I stared at him horrified.</p>
                <p>"'Again?' I said. 'Do realize that I have never yet painted, and that I do not
                    yet know whether I shall ever be able to start painting.' </p>
                <p>"He looked at me sternly. For the first time I saw a doubt in his eyes. He
                    said:</p>

                        >Andreas</persName> come to life in youâ€”what was immortal in him, the divine
                    spark, his artistic genius. And if you are not yet able to acknowledge the truth
                    of this creative impulse which is slumbering within you, which must find an
                    outlet somehow, you are at least in a position to teach others, especially young
                    people who have a distinct talent for painting.'</p>
                <p>"He had risen to his feet and was pacing the room in a state of excitement.</p>
                <p>"'I have read your confession, page for page, as you know, and I perceive
                    something like timidity peeping out of avowal. You are a woman. Sometimes you
                    are afraid of saying the last thing, for the last thing is the completely naked
                    and the brutal. But all truth, in fact, is brutal. Much of it is even shameless,
                    and there are very few people who can understand and endure the most intimate
                    and perfect shame, that is the shame of shamelessness.'</p>
                <p>"Then I took up his word: 'Do you mean that I am not candid enough?'</p>
                <p>"He remained standing in front of me, took my hand, slipped my arm in his, and
                    walked with me slowly up and down his room.</p>
                <p>"'<persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, you have described yourself as a
                    bridge-builder, who is building a bridge from the solid bank of to-day. And you
                    said yourself that you did not know whether the other bank was the past or the
                    future.'</p>
                <p>"Then he lapsed into silence.</p>
                <p>"We were both standing in front of the window of his room, whence could be seen

                <p>harbour, and across a sea of roofs the sparkling water of the sound.</p>
                <p>"We had both fallen silent. Then he resumed: </p>
                <p>"'This bridge, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, will go much farther
                    into the past that you have any suspicion of to-day. In fact, across that abyss
                    which separates man from woman. That is the remarkable thing about your fate,
                    the unique thing that slumbers within you, namely, the emotional bond between
                    the two sexes. This presentiment in your blood, which now pulsates through a
                    woman's heart as it formerly pulsated through the heart of a man, rises now and
                    again through the mists of ambiguity into a penetrating insight. And you have
                    transferred this intuition to the pages of your confession in a scrappy sort of
                    way and perhaps expressed it in inadequate and tentative words. And frequently
                    your words only hint at the thing, frequently you are silent, probably out of
                    suppressed shame. This new country, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>,
                    this new country of the soul, is lying dormant within you, and whether you like
                    it not, it will go on expanding.'</p>
                <p>"Then he was silent.</p>
                <p>"I ensconced myself in the darkest corner of his room and shut my eyes. He had
                    not seen that I was weeping. I went home quite alone. On another occasion I
                    asked him if he would send me as a pupil his little daughter, a sixteen-year-old
                    girl who had been attending the Copenhagen art school for a few months."</p>

                <p>The next morning Lili received a letter from <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude

                <p>"My dear little <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>,</p>
                <p>"I will do no more than tell you that I have to be in Copenhagen on business
                    within the next few days. I shall be there next week.</p>
                <p>"In haste,</p>
                <p>"Your <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>."</p>
                <p>For a whole week Lili and <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> were
                    together from morning to night. She showed him the city and its extensive
                    environs, and the whole atmosphere was redolent of spring.</p>
                <p>She was happy. The best friend of her youth had at last joined her again.</p>
                <p>He told her the latest news from Paris, and all the memories of the many, many
                    happy hours which they had both spent there and in the South of France revived
                    in her until her whole memory, as if awakened from darkness, now seemed to her
                    like an iridescent firmament.</p>
                <p>"Do you remember thisâ€”do you remember that?" asked <persName key="lejeuneClaude"
                        >Claude</persName>, who could hardly wait for an answer and went on
                    talking.</p>
                <p>And Lili said to everything: "Yes, yes," and her eyes were shining with

                <p>But now and again she had a secret feeling of something new and different
                    stirring in her, and she did not know what it was.</p>
                <p>. . . . .</p>
                <p>"Claude and I were sitting this evening in a restaurant, when he suddenly
                    said:</p>
                <p>"'Look here, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, I must take you home now.
                    It is very late, and I am afraid that I shall be compromising you.'</p>
                <p>"I was obliged to laugh loudly. Such words I had never before heard from
                        <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>'s mouth.</p>
                <p>"But when I looked at him, I felt that he was quite serious in what he said, so I
                    was obedient and rose to my feet.</p>
                <p>"When we were seated side by side in the taxicab, I said to him:</p>
                <p>"'Claude, you look so solemn. Are you no longer as gay as you used to be when you
                    were with me in Paris and on the Loire?'</p>
                <p>"Claude seized my hand and answered: </p>
                <p>"Perhaps you are right. During these few days I have in fact observed something
                    new in you, something which I did not notice at the time when, if I may so
                    express it, you were not yet born. Now you are a healthy creature, but so
                    defenceless. You are an adult woman, but you often seem to me like a child. You
                    ought to have somebody who would be both a mother and a husband. In a few days I
                    must be off again, and I find it very painful to leave you here alone, exposed
                    to all dangers, as people in Copenhagen, where everybody knew <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, regard you, whether you admit it or not,
                    as a</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>phenomenon, even when they are good to you. You cannot, in fact, run away from
                    your past.' </p>
                <p>"Claude looked at me long and earnestly. I asked him:</p>
                <p>"'What am I to do, then?'</p>
                <p>"'You must go away from here.'</p>
                <p>"I nodded.</p>
                <p>"'It is my intention to do so. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> is
                    expecting me in Italy in June. But before going there I want to go to Dresden
                    once more, to the Women's Clinic, to spend a few summer days or weeks there, as
                    I did last year.'</p>
                <p>"Claude shook his head.</p>
                <p>"'What plans, what plans, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>! Nothing but
                    long journeys. And quite alone. It is indeed very nice of <persName

                    them, but don't forget they are a newly married pair. Have happy people, who
                    have neglected their happiness so long, room for a third person?'</p>
                <p>"And then <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> was silent again, until
                    he suddenly said:</p>
                <p>"'I must tell you that in the course of a few days I shall be transferred from
                    Paris to Turkey, and I must start on my journey within a week at least.'
                        <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> had for a number of years
                    been a consular official.</p>
                <p>"He gazed at me with his large, open, kind eyes and asked:</p>
                <p>"'Will you come with me, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>?'</p>
                <p>"The question came so suddenly that I looked at him incredulously. 'Do you really
                    want me with you?'</p>
                <p>"Claude said seriously: 'My little <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>,

                <p>you doubt it? Will you marry me? Will you be my wife?'</p>
                <p>"Quite involuntarily, as if I had not spoken myself, I said: 'Yes, oh, yes,
                        <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>.' And I still heard my words
                    ringing in my ear. They were uttered without agitation, as softly as a
                    schoolgirl speaks.</p>
                <p>"And consequently I did not even remark <persName key="lejeuneClaude"
                        >Claude</persName>'s agitation when he suddenly took both my hands and
                    kissed them. Only when <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> pressed
                    me to him and kissed me on the mouth did I realize what he and I had said, and
                    an unaccountable feeling flooded me, something which I had never perceived
                    before, something blissful, yet frightening.</p>
                <p>"And suddenly I heard, as if coming from afar, the words which Werner Kreutz had
                    spoken to me the last time I had seen him: 'Go out and flutter your wings and

                <p>"I tore myself from <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> in terror. He
                    regarded me with startled eyes and asked me: 'What's the matter? Don't you like
                    me any more, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>?'</p>
                <p>"I answered: 'You know quite well what I think of you.' I heard my own words; I
                    scarcely recognized my voice. 'But I cannot marry you until I have asked
                    Professor Kreutz. Without his permission I can do nothing. He alone has the
                    right to dispose of me.'</p>
                <p>"'What do you mean,' asked <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>, and
                    his eyes regarded me distressfully.</p>
                <p>"I groped for words. Involuntarily I thought of the conversation which I had had
                    with my</p>
                <p><num style="page">266</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>German friend. I heard his words as he spoke to me: 'The shame of
                    shamelessness.'</p>
                <p>"'Do say something,' I heard <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> say
                    again.</p>
                <p>"I stammered:</p>
                <p>"'Claude, I do not know if I ought to marry yetâ€”perhaps I am not yet strong
                    enough, although I look well enough. Let me first go to my helper in Germany. I
                    must discuss with him what is to become of me, whither my path leads.'</p>
                <p>. . . . .</p>
                <p>"The following day, sixteen-year-old Ruth, the daughter of my German friend, was
                    sitting with me. She was painting her first picture, a portrait of herself. I
                    was standing behind her, but it was hardly necessary for me to tell her how to
                    paint. I told her about myself and the Women's Clinic and many other things
                    which moved me and which my little pupil perhaps did not really understand. We
                    are very happy together. I saw that I could give her a good deal of useful
                    advice. After she had gone, leaving the picture she had begun standing on the
                    easel which I had inherited fromâ€”Andreas, I searched among the many pictures
                    which were still left over from <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s and
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' last exhibition (although most
                    had been sold) for an empty piece of canvas. I stretched it on the frame, took
                    the picture of my little pupil off the easel, and placed the empty canvas on it.
                    And suddenly I took a brush myself and began to paint. What I wanted to paint I
                    did not know. And I painted and painted.</p>

                <p><num style="page">267</num></p>
                <p>"Suddenly there was a knock at the door. Another knock came and then another.</p>
                <p>"I could not leave the easel. Something held me fastâ€”and there was <persName
                        key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> standing behind me.</p>
                <p>"'You are painting, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>?' he inquired with
                    astonishment. 'And what is your picture intended to represent?'</p>
                <p>"'Yes, so you see, <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>,' I answered,
                    somewhat uncertainly, and again my mind went back to the conversation which I
                    had recently had with my German friend. 'I am trying to see whether I can make a
                    start. Almost as soon as you leave I shall be starting on my long journey, and
                    then I should like to take a picture with me to my Professor. My very first
                    picture. He possesses pictures by <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>,
                    and I should like to see how I really compare with him as a painter. Yesterday
                    evening when you brought me home I had an idea.'</p>
                <p>"'Yes, but what is your picture intended to represent, <persName key="courtaud"
                        >Lili</persName>, dear?'</p>
                <p>"We were both standing in front of my picture, and he said: 'Have you not painted
                    a heart?'</p>
                <p>"I was almost ashamed to admit it. 'Yes,' I said; 'it is my heart, which has been
                    left behind in the Women's Clinic.'</p>
                <p>"Claude gazed at me sadly and inquiringly, and I took his hand.</p>
                <p>"'Don't take it amiss, <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>; you do
                    not yet understand it. You see, the Women's Clinic was my peaceful, white
                    nursery. Consequently, Professor Kreutz must have this picture. He won't be
                    angry with me. Nor will he laugh at</p>
                <p><num style="page">268</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>the picture. He understands me. And I want nothing more than to see his smile
                    when I give him the picture.</p>
                <p>"'I am so fond of you, <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>, and I am
                    dreaming already of our being together and living together in the South, in a
                    setting of tropical flowers and palm trees and dazzling sunshine. And you will
                    have a garden. I can see this garden already in my mind's eye.</p>
                <p>"'But I am also dreaming of another garden. In this garden there are white
                    flowers and white birch trees. And there I am strolling, white and pure, under a
                    mild and clear sky. Perhaps it is the Garden of Paradise. My dear man, life is
                    still such a new and immense thing for me. I feel so weak under all the strong
                    emotions which I sometimes feel stirring in my heart. I have long since realized
                    that the life of a woman mainly consists of sorrow and yearning. And yet it is
                    so wonderful to be alive.</p>
                <p>"Claude said: 'Poor little <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>,' and folded
                    me lightly in his arms as if I were a child. 'I often think that Nature was in
                    one of her mysterious moods when she packed all that is most feminine on earth
                    in your sensitive little soul; everyone can hurt and wound you because you are
                    so unprotected. It is for this reason I want to take you with me so badly. Won't
                    you come?'</p>
                <p>"I looked quite calmly at <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> and
                    gave him both my hands: 'Go in peace, <persName key="lejeuneClaude"
                        >Claude</persName>, and wait for me, but don't ask me any more. I understand
                    all too little of what is stirring within me, and discover something new and
                    unknown in me every day.'</p>

                <p><num style="page">269</num></p>
                <p>"Then I wept. We were standing quite close before the picture of my heart.</p>
                <p>"The next day I accompanied <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> to
                    the station.</p>
                <p>. . . . .</p>
                <p>Rain was falling steadily from grey skies. White birch trees were gleaming like
                    silver in front of dark, dripping fir woods. A range of blue hills swelled on
                    the distant horizon.</p>
                <p>Lili looked at her wrist-watch. Within less than an hour she would be in her
                    beautiful city of the Elbe.</p>
                <p>She let herself be lulled by the soft rocking rhythm of the train. With eyes half
                    opened she sat in her corner by the window, watching the dear, familiar
                    landscape rushing past.</p>
                <p>Frequently her heart beat so violently that she had to clutch her breast, and a
                    current stirred in her blood.</p>
                <p>Then she sank back into a semi-conscious state of dreaming, in which she had lain
                    since she entered the Dresden train at the Berlin station.</p>
                <p>She had deliberately taken the same train as on the occasion, more than a year
                    before, when she had left Berlin for the South in order to find a refuge in the
                    Women's Clinic.</p>
                <p>It was not early spring as then. It was summer; but something of the fresh young
                    spring and the magic of the imminent ripeness hovered over the rainy day.</p>
                <p>She had closed her eyes and tried to collect her thoughts. The year that had
                    passed wandered through her memory like a hurried, endless pilgrimage, this
                    first dangerous year of her life through</p>
                <p><num style="page">270</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>which she had wandered like a sleepwalker on the edge of a precipice and yet
                    always accompanied in a mysterious way by guardian angels. And she thought of
                    her helper, and whether he would be satisfied with her. Was she worthy of all he
                    had done for her? Not until this moment did it dawn upon her that she had been
                    placed at a post which she was not allowed to leave. And she vowed to herself
                    that nothing which had been sown in her personality should lie fallow.
                    Everything in her should sprout and blossom and become fruit, in her life and in
                    her work, in her art, which, as she now knew, was only waiting to be quickened
                    into vigorous life.</p>
                <p>How she had fared up till now she had recorded in her diary. Her confessions were
                    almost completed. They were left behind in Copenhagen, in the shape of a bundle
                    of foolscap covered with writing. One day her confessionsâ€”and she smiled at this
                    thoughtâ€”would burst upon mankind as the confessions of the first person who was
                    not born unconsciously through a mother's travail, but fully conscious through
                    her own pangs.</p>
                <p>She wanted to be a bridge-builder.</p>
                <p>She recalled the phrase of her German friend in Copenhagen and thought that she
                    had perhaps built a slender bridge across that abyss which separates man and
                    woman.</p>
                <p>Like a far-off dream she saw in her mind's eye the Copenhagen railway station,
                    all the companions and friends of those vanished days and weeks and months she
                    had passed in the northern capital.</p>
                <p>She also saw among them the little schoolgirl</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">271</num></p>
                <p>Ruth, who had been her pupil. She had taught in order to learn that she too could
                    henceforth paint, and that she was now strong enough to claim that immortal
                    heritage which <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had bequeathed to
                    her.</p>
                <p>And she smiled again when she thought of the dark girlish head of her pupil Ruth
                    etched against the bright background, where the palms of the South were waving
                    in a blue spring sky; and these palms and this sky were nothing but a corner of
                    a picture which she possessed from <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>,
                    her dead brother, and which he had discovered during his last Italian summer,
                    spent in the company of <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName
                        key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName>.</p>
                <p>"Ruth," she had then said to her pupil, "I owe it to <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> that I am now able to guide your first steps into your
                    art. So for your first picture you should borrow something from what was perhaps
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' last picture."</p>
                <p>Lili closed her eyes and continued to smile.</p>
                <p>Then the train slowed down. She opened her eyes and looked out of the window:
                    Neustadt! Was it possible?</p>
                <p>In feverish haste she put on her hat and coat. Slowly the train moved again, and
                    was now crossing the great bridge over the Elbe. Suddenly Dresden burst on her
                    vision, her beautiful and beloved city of the Elbe. Domes and towers were
                    reflected in the wide river, her river.</p>
                <p>Trembling violently she glued herself to the carriage window. She clenched her
                    teeth in a frenzied effort to keep back the tears. No, she must not weep
                    now.</p>
                <p>A few minutes later she was sitting in a car</p>
                <p><num style="page">272</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>which took her to the Women's Clinic. Chastened but cheerful she entered the
                    portal of the home of her heart. Suddenly she hesitated, looked around her, and
                    for the first time a doubt assailed her. "Why have I come here at all? And what
                    do I want to ask him?" Thus she stood irresolute in the grounds.</p>
                <p>The rain had ceased. The white birch trees lifted their light, bright crowns to
                    the pale, watery sky. A couple of white-clad nurses nodded a greeting. Young
                    doctors in professional attire strode through the park. Pregnant women were
                    strolling there: "Blue crocuses," she thought, with a smile.</p>
                <p>She remained standing and regarded the young women. Now she knew why she had
                    come.</p>
                <p>A white-clad figure stood at the door which led to the private ward, and with a
                    cry of joy Lili threw herself into the motherly arms of <persName key="matron"
                        >the Matron</persName>. One nurse after another came up, and they all
                    rejoiced at the reunion.</p>
                <p>Everything was unchanged.</p>
                <p>Lili took <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName>'s hand. "Come with me just
                    once through the house. I want to see all the corridors again."</p>
                <p>And <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName> took her through all the
                    corridors.</p>
                <p>When she was tired out, she sat down in one of the large easy chairs in the long
                    corridor through the great folding doors of which fell a beam of greenish light.
                    Perhaps she would have to wait a long time.</p>
                <p>She said the words to herself like a childish wish:</p>
                <p>"Wait a long time, wait a long time."</p>

                <p><num style="page">273</num></p>
                <p>She drank in the smell of ether and formalin as if she were thirsty. And all the
                    familiar noises from the corridors and halls and rooms crowded in upon her.</p>
                <p>She waited. A blissful peace invaded her mind.</p>
                <p>The folding doors opened. A slender figure in a white overall, with dark hair
                    over the lofty brow, came towards her.</p>
                <p>Like a sleepwalker she let herself be led into the Professor's room.</p>
                <p>And she listened fascinated to the strange, muffled voice. She had quite
                    forgotten why she had come. She had forgotten everything she wanted to ask. She
                    could only say: "Yes, Professor."</p>
                <p>Suddenly Werner Kreutz looked at her sharply.</p>
                <p>"What do you want to ask me? I can tell from your expression that you want
                    something. Tell me what it is. . . ." Lili roused herself from her stupor. The
                    secret anxiety which she could never banish now gripped her, and, looking the
                    while calmly into his eyes, she said:</p>
                <p>"Tell me, Professor, do you think that I am now strong enough for another
                    operation, for I want so much to become a mother."</p>

                <p>Fragments from <persName key="courtaud">Lili Elbe</persName>'s letters to her
                    German friend in the period from 14th June to 22nd August, 1931, from
                    Dresden.</p>
                <p>"14th June. </p>
                <p>"After a short examination Professor Kreutz decided to operate upon me again. It
                    will be the last time. Probably the operation will be performed on Tuesday, but
                    promise me that <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> shall hear nothing
                    about it. It would cast a shadow over her happiness. She would be worrying on my
                    account, for which there is no need. I am so pleased to be here in my Women's
                    Clinic again. The Professor has promised to read my 'Confessions' and to help
                    me, should it be necessary, to correct them. He too is of opinion that they
                    ought to appear as a book.</p>
                <p>"For the rest I consider it splendid of him, instead of resting on his laurels,
                    to incur the risk of operating upon me once more, so that I should be quite well

                    last breath with him to whom I owe my life.</p>
                <p>"More than ever, then, I am convinced that it is my moral duty to make my
                    'Confessions' public, in order to teach people not to judge."</p>
                <p>"15th June.</p>
                <p>"Now that I am again in Dresden, which is my home, and you have read the last
                    word of my 'Confessions', 'I want so much to become a mother!' I feel impelled
                    to write you, my friend and father-confessor, at very great length. I shall
                    perhaps be somewhat prolix, but have patience with me. I have no time to lose.
                    In two days I shall be operated upon again.</p>
                <p>"You must sympathize with me in my desire for maternity, to have a child, for I
                    want nothing more ardently than to demonstrate that <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> has been completely obliterated in meâ€”is dead. Through a
                    child I should be able to convince myself in the most unequivocal manner that I
                    have been a woman from the very beginning.</p>
                <p>"Please understand me: the alienation from <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> must inevitably crystallize into the resolution to
                    forget a person who, as <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, has been a
                    tragic obstacle which prevented me from experiencing all the mysteries and
                    wonders which are part of the life of the girl, the maid, and the woman, in the
                    same way as all other members of my sex. Because I lived a first life encased in
                    a panser, from which I could not get free, my youth as girl and maiden has
                    been</p>

                <p>stolen from me, has been suppressed. This also explains why then I returned to
                    Denmark from Germany. The atmosphere of Copenhagen felt most repellent. Denmark
                    was the stage on which <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> made his
                    first appearance; it was his homeâ€”for me, on the contrary, it was nothing less
                    than a cast-off snake-skin. Consequently, Copenhagen was a very difficult place
                    for me to return to, because I had to fight not only for my future, but against
                    my past, which was really not my past at all, but the past of an alien creature
                    who had also robbed me of my home. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>,
                    therefore, appears to me to-day in the light of a usurper. For the same reason I
                    find it hard to endure the South and West of Europe, because everything there is
                    bound up with <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' past. On the other
                    hand, my love for Germany, for Berlin, and above all for Dresden, is easy to
                    understand; <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> did not know these
                    cities, these landscapes and the atmosphere of Germany, his acquaintance with
                    them being of the most cursory character when he was in a dying condition. What
                    a boon for me it was to be here, where it is only present and future for me, and
                    where there is no past connected with <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>! Here I have merely to fight for my future from the
                    basis of the present, unburdened by the painful past of another person.</p>
                <p>"But I must return to Denmark in order to complete my 'Confessions', to that
                    atmosphere which is most painful for me because it was there that I felt most

                <p>"You, dear friend, in your tender way and the Danes in their coarser and more
                    brutal manner (because they have only eyes for the commonplace and the
                    uncomplicatedâ€”they call it 'common sense' and the 'normal', because it is the
                    most comfortable, and my countrymen are intellectual, and not only intellectual
                    but damnably comfortable), have frequently asked me whether I could remember
                    anything of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' erotic emotions. In
                    putting this question people touched me on the sorest point of my sensibilities,
                    without their knowing it. If Nature in alliance with the art of my Professor had
                    not come to my assistance, so that I no longer felt anything in my blood of
                    these emotions of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, of the erotic
                    sensations which he had experienced with women, I should have felt defiled and
                    befouled as a woman by this feeling of alien sexual emotions.</p>
                <p>"I am fighting against the prepossession of the Philistine who looks upon me as a
                    phenomenon, as an abnormality. As I am now, I am a perfectly ordinary woman
                    among other women. The scepticism of the Philistine, or rather the easy-going
                    neighbours who only recognize the commonplace as the justification of life, who
                    invest me and my fate with the quality of a sensation, often depresses me so
                    severely that I find myself wanting to die and playing with the idea of
                    suicide.</p>
                <p>"But the will to live is stronger in me than any humiliation which I have

                <p>my fellows and which may be in store for me. I have duties towards <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, who on my account has hazarded her
                    existence in order to liberate me from the <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> integumentâ€”towards my Professor, who allied himself to
                    me with his medical art and created me for what I am, that is, gave me
                    justification as a living creature, made me into a normal woman.</p>
                <p>"Because of all these obligations I must preserve and strengthen my will to
                    live.</p>
                <p>"If I should succumb spiritually and seek suicide, everybody would be right in
                    saying that what had happened to me had been contrary to Nature, an audacious
                    challenge of the unnatural and the artificial to the natural and to Nature; a
                    creature born as an hermaphrodite must remain an hermaphrodite, especially if it
                    has lived as an hermaphrodite for a lifetime. That without the operation
                    performed by the Professor I should have died with <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> more than a year ago does not trouble them. But that I,
                        <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, am vital and have a right to life
                    I have proved by living for fourteen months. It may be said that fourteen months
                    is not much, but they seem to me like a whole and happy human life. The price
                    which I have paid seems to me very small.</p>
                <p>"If sooner or later I should succumb physically, I am quite reconciled. I shall
                    at least have known what it is to live.</p>
                <p>"My will to live! On this account I have steeled my strength in recent months,
                    and often forced myself to do many things which <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> once did or perhaps didâ€”yet I was often displeased</p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">279</num></p>
                <p>when I found that I had done the thing in question not only as well as, but
                    better than, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. I was often vexed to
                    discover this, for it reminded me of the virile qualities associated with
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>.</p>
                <p>"Recently, a few days before my departure for Dresden, I looked over all the
                    photographs which had been taken of me in the Women's Clinic a year ago. What a
                    childishly simple and effeminate expression all the pictures of that time
                    reveal! How imploring and helpless the glance! Then I looked in the mirror to
                    see what I am like now. My face has become smoother, and healthier, and fresher,
                    the whole body more taut and feminine. But my eyes have a self-conscious
                    expression. I am not pleased at this; life has hardened me.</p>
                <p>"Now I have returned once more. Here, where the strong will of another stands
                    between me and the outside world, as my protector and defender, I can cast off
                    the assumed sternness of my character. It is not really sternness, but a very
                    fragile shell around a completely defenceless creature.</p>
                <p>"Here you have, dear friend, the explanation of my whole character, of my
                    endeavour and my deepest longing; all that I desire is nothing less than the
                    last fulfilment of a real woman; to be protected from life by the sterner being,
                    the husband. I think death would be more welcome to me than, for instance, a
                    life as artist, even as a great and fÃªted artist on my own account. For I do not
                    want to be an artist, but a woman. Hence I must shut all artistic creation</p>
                <p><num style="page">280</num></p>
                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>out of my lifeâ€”you will remember I insisted on this during our last
                    conversationâ€”because I cannot continue the work of the virile artist who was
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>.</p>
                <p>"And in contrast to <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, who had to
                    create the works of art from inner compulsion, my own life feels deflected from
                    everything that constitutes art. Do I make myself clear? It is not with my
                    brain, not with my eyes, not with my hands that I want to be creative, but with
                    my heart and with my blood. The fervent longing in my woman's life is to become
                    the mother of a child. Whether this wish can be fulfilled or not, the fact that
                    I can openly acknowledge this desire from the fullness of a pure woman's heart
                    is an infinite happiness for me. The fact that I may experience this happiness
                    justifies everything that has happened to me here in Dresden.</p>
                <p>"And because it is so, dear friend, the Confessions which I have placed in your
                    hands must end on the note that expresses my strongest craving: 'I want so much
                    to become a mother.'</p>
                <p>"Now you will understand me and now you will be able to teach others to
                    understand me.</p>
                <p>"In two days I shall probably be operated upon. It is to be the last time. So it
                    is well that I have poured out all my heart to you to-day.</p>
                <p>"16th June.</p>
                <p>"Now I am just as insignificant as I was last year.</p>
                <p>"I believe I am to be operated upon tomorrow. I am not afraid of the pain. I

                <p>"To-day it is a month since I was operated upon . . . progress is being
                    maintained . . . and my mind is no longer dwelling upon the subject of death.
                    Last night I dreamed that a friend took me in his arms and carried me off, and I
                    was happy. I have gone through so much, but so much is expected of me. Now I
                    know that I am like all women.</p>
                <p>"19th July.</p>
                <p>"My friend Iven Person of the Theatre Royal, Copenhagen (the only one of
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' friends to extend his
                    friendship to me), and his ravishingly beautiful Ebba, came to see me yesterday.
                    It was delightful. I wept for joy. They were so good to me. Iven said that when
                    he was back in Copenhagen he would arrange a lecture for me; the most eminent
                    artists were to take part in it. I was to have all the proceeds, Iven kept
                    saying, 'Don't worry, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>. Everything</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p><num style="page">283</num></p>
                <p>will turn out well. All you have to do is to get better.' Iven is so strong and
                    he has a heart that feels for others. And both of them said that I had grown
                    prettier. Much to my delight.</p>
                <p>"Should I write a preface to the book, to explain why, when speaking of <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, I always use the third person, as in a
                    novel? But, my dear friend, what other form of narrative could I have chosen? I
                    could not relate the story of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' life
                    in the first person. Nor could I employ the third person when speaking of my own
                    life and experiences, after <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had
                    vanished. I was too close to everything. Hence, I often found it repugnant to
                    speak of myself as of a third person. How lucky I was to secure the long
                    narrative which <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> dictated to Niels in
                    Berlin before the first operation!</p>
                <p>"Yes, if I had been able to wait before completing the book, as you always
                    advised me, I could perhaps have recorded everything in a better, and stronger,
                    and more direct style. You say that the people who read my book will want to
                    know something about the nature and progress of the operations.</p>
                <p>"Ought I to say that when <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was taking
                    part in Iven's ballet in Paris, he suddenly started to menstruate, without
                    knowing it, just like a woman, that these discharges then recurred at regular
                    intervals, and that their character was first perceived by Werner Kreutz. Ought
                    I to say that the first operation in Berlin was the castration of <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, that immediately afterwards his voice
                    changed into mine and his handwriting into mine, but that <persName

                    who was neither man nor woman, entered the Women's Clinic in the spring of last
                    year? Ought I to say that the male organ was then removed, the body opened and
                    my ovaries found, which, however, had been stunted by the wrong treatment in
                    Paris? Ought I to say that then I, <persName key="courtaud">Lili</persName>, was
                    supplied with fresh ovaries from a woman of six-and-twenty, which 'normalized'
                    my whole being and its functions, that henceforth I was and am a woman like
                    other women, and that I have now returned to Dresden for the last operation to
                    effect a natural outlet from the womb.</p>
                <p>"Oh, dear friend, more than this I cannot write. I can discuss all this with you,
                    as I proved in Copenhagen. You know full well how I have striven in order to
                    find the simplest and smoothest language for my 'Confessions'. I am indeed no
                    writer. And this book, which arose out of diary entries and descriptive extracts
                    and letters, I had to write in such a short time, between late autumn and
                    spring, between two very serious operations, as if between two battles. To be
                    sure, I hope through this book to be able to provide for my material existence.
                    Can I be reproached for that?</p>
                <p>"No! And then I am writing all this in order to render an account of myself and
                    my helper. That he, having read and approved the German text thereof, is
                    satisfied with my narrative, is my greatest joy and deepest satisfaction. I
                    could</p>

                <p><num style="page">285</num></p>
                <p>not give more than a picture of the soul, a human document, a 'confession', as
                    you call my narrative. And if many chapters read like a novel, you and, above
                    all, my helper, and <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, and <persName
                        key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>, you all know that it is no romance,
                    but nothing less than the strictly veracious life-story of a creature seeking
                    clarity and peace and rest, and who wants to remain with her friend as his
                    companion.</p>
                <p>"I should like to give you a little present. Hence I am sending you <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' book, <hi rend="italic">Le Livre des
                        Vikings</hi>, which he published in 1924, in conjunction with <persName
                        key="gyuot">Ch. Gyuot</persName>, at L'Edition d'Art H. Piazza, Paris. You
                    are to keep it as a memento. Look at the first page! <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> has written on it: 'To my dear <persName key="father"
                        >father</persName>â€”from <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, Paris
                    21.2.1924. And underneath I have written: 'To my friend . . . <persName
                        key="courtaud">Lili Elbe</persName>, Copenhagen, 5th June, 1931.' On the 5th
                    June I was with you for the last time. The following day I left for Dresden.
                    When shall I be with you again?</p>
                <p>"7th August.</p>
                <p>"I was talking to the Professor to-day about my book, and what he said about it
                    gave me keen pleasure. Next week he is going on his vacation. Just think of it,
                    they have not yet allowed me to get up. But it cannot be long now before I am on
                    my feet again. I think there should be a foreword to the book stating, 'This
                    book deals with my life and my transformation; it is written by a creature who
                    is still weak and impotent. . . ."</p>

                <p>"13th August.</p>
                <p>"The Professor has left for his holiday. My condition brings me to despair. I
                    cannot see that I am making any progress, but there are moments when I am so
                    tired that I almost wish I could die; but I have nor received permission to do
                    this, as I know the Professor will not have it.</p>
                <p>"15th August.</p>
                <p>"I cannot write about my last operationâ€”it was an abyss of suffering. It is well
                    that <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> does not know. I am still so
                    weak; but in Sept. I shall return to Copenhagen. I must put my papers in order,
                    for <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>'s sake.</p>
                <p>"17th August.</p>
                <p>"I don't want to bother you with my troubles, but it is now two months since the
                    strict Professor has kept me in bed. It was a terrible time, and I am so
                    unutterably tired of it. I do not expect to return to Copenhagen before the end
                    of September.</p>
                <p>"22nd August.</p>
                <p>"I am so tired, I am constantly tired, and I am still lying in bed. Almost every
                    day I receive flowers from <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> . . . she
                    is happy. If I had the strength, I would write and tell her that I am
                    progressing. She would come to me; but that I don't want. I am so lonely and so
                    weak. But when I am most dejected, a letter </p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>

                <p>comes from <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>; he is waiting for
                    meâ€”dear, dear <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>.</p>
                <p>. . . . .</p>
                <p>The shadows were closing round <persName key="courtaud">Lili Elbe</persName>. She
                    wrote one more letter at the beginning of September. It was addressed to her
                    sister.</p>
                <p>"Now I know that death is near. Last night I dreamt about Mother. She took me in
                    her arms and called me Lili . . . and <persName key="father">Father</persName>
                    was also there. . . ."</p>
                <p>On the 12th September Lili's brother was summoned to Dresden by telegraph. She
                    was no longer able to speak. She could only whisper. But her eyes were shining
                    when her brother was with her. She wrote her last words on a card. She gave the
                    card to her faithful nurse in the Women's Clinic, "<hi rend="italic">Au
                        revoir,</hi> sister." Then she fell asleep and did not wake again. Paralysis
                    of the heart put an end to her short young woman's life, which was so
                    excruciating and yet so wonderful.</p>
                <p>Her dearest wish was to be allowed to rest in the cemetery near the Women's
                    Hospital, and on the 15th September, 1931, her wish was fulfilled.</p>
                <p>When <persName key="courtaud">Lili Elbe</persName> was with her German friend for
                    the last timeâ€”on the 5th June, 1931, the day before her last journey to Dresden,
                    she opened a book. It was the first volume of Hans Jager's shattering
                    confessions, <hi rend="italic">Sick Love</hi>. Lili read for a while. Suddenly
                    she paused, handed her friend the book, pointed to a passage therein, and said:
                    "If I should not return, may it be appropriate to</p>

                <p>MAN INTO WOMAN</p>
                <p>conclude my book with these words from Hans Jager"</p>
                <p>With a trembling voice <persName key="courtaud">Lili Elbe</persName> read the
                    passage:</p>
                <p>"'When I myself am no longer here, I want my sad book of love to be my legacy, a
                    testimony that I once lived. I imagine that this book will be read, read as few
                    books are, by all who are unhappy in love, into whose hands it shall fall year
                    after year, and I feel as if I could shake them all by the hand. And I have such
                    an unspeakable longing; it is in fact the only longing that I have, to say
                    farewell to allâ€”oh, none can realize what ultimate peace this would be for
                    me."'</p>
